<p class="ph2">THE PRINCESS ATHURA<br />


<small>A Romance of Iran</small></p>


<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>THE GREAT KING’S LAST BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was morning on the plains of Asia. Long-legged
herons stood in the shallows of the yellow Jaxartes,
bathing their feet in its sluggish flood and warming
their bodies in the first rays of the sun. They were
silently and uneasily watching a host of armed men
drawn out in long battle-lines across the lowlands bordering
the southern margin of the stream.</p>

<p>Where the armed host stood was a sandy plain, about
two miles wide. Beyond this was a low range of sand-hills,
which trended away to the southeast, enlarging
the plain as they receded from the river. Cutting
through hills and plain to join the river-bed was a dry
water-course, where, in winters only, a torrent flowed.
In it were some stunted trees and scattered thickets of
shrubs. To the north of the river was a vast plain on
which the dry, yellow grass had been withered by summer
sun and wind. Far in the east appeared dimly
through a blue haze the summits of high mountains.
Westward the river had yet to flow half its length to
the Oxian swamps. Here it was wide and shallow and
its banks were low and marshy.</p>

<p>The rays of the sun sparkled on the brazen breastplates
and shining blades of battle-axes, on the spear-points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
and gilded helmets, of two hundred thousand men,
who here awaited the approach of a far more numerous
host coming down from the east along the river towards
them. The light rested softly upon the stern, bearded
faces of veterans of many wars and the softer cheeks of
young men on this, their first campaign. They were men
of Iran for the most part, though some were Assyrians,
Babylonians, Arabs, Hebrews, or Greeks from the
Ionian cities. They were followers of Cyrus, the King
of Kings, the Great King, ever victorious Lord of the
World.</p>

<p>Those about to attack them were Touranian horsemen,
known to ancient history as Scythians, Massagetæ, Sacæ,
and to modern history as Tartars, Turks, or Kalmuks.
The hearts of the soldiers of Cyrus were glad. For
the long, dusty marches in pursuit of an ever retreating
enemy would now end in a riot of blood and slaughter,
and perhaps they might then set their faces homeward.
No doubt of victory entered their minds. They were
led by Cyrus, the invincible. It mattered not if the
enemy outnumbered them three to one, as their scouts
had reported. There would be more killing and a
greater victory.</p>

<p>Racial hatred, reaching back beyond history and tradition
to the distant age when the first family of man
threw off branches to different parts of the earth and
the branches immediately claimed the pleasant places
and fought each other for them, animated both parties
to the coming conflict. The folklore of the early Aryans
is largely composed of tales concerning heroes who had
saved their people from the ravages of those fierce men
of the North, the Touranians. Century after century the
wandering hordes of the great northern plains hovered,
like threatening clouds, along the boundaries of Iran,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
looking across the mountains from their own arid and
wind-swept abodes to the rich and pleasant hills and valleys
of the South. The children of those tribes, in the
days of Tamerlane and Mohammed, broke over all barriers,
crushed Eastern civilization, and put back the clock
of progress a thousand years.</p>

<p>Once even before the time of Cyrus, the wild Touranians
had passed over the mountains and pushed
through into Mesopotamia, bearing woe to the nations.
Then, one day, their captains sat down to a banquet prepared
by the conquered ones and instead of meats were
fed with sword-blows and dagger-thrusts. Having thus
been deprived of leaders, the Touranian conquerors had
suffered disaster; and all had been either killed, enslaved,
or driven back across the mountains. Stories of that
invasion were thereafter told at every fireside of the
Bactrians, Medes, Persians, and their kindred tribes; and
the mothers in Iran frightened their children into obedience
by threatening to hand them over to the dreaded
monsters of Touran.</p>

<p>Having conquered all civilized Asia, Cyrus had
thought to rest in his palaces at Hamadan, or Susa,
Babylon, or Pasargadæ; but there had come word from
ancient Balk, or Bactra, the mother city of all Aryans,
warning him that the Touranians were gathering for war
in numbers so immense that help must be sent. The
great war-king had at once responded. With half a
million men he had marched into Bactra, to the aid of
King Hystaspis, who, under him, ruled there, and, passing
through the mountains on its northern border, he
had driven back the leading troops of the enemy. The
Touranians had retreated, seeking to draw him into the
great plains, where they hoped that they might crush
him with overwhelming numbers. He had followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
carefully, building forts as he advanced, that his supply-line
might be safe, and leaving strong detachments to
guard them. With less than half his army, though its
best part, he had arrived at the great river, Jaxartes,
and had waited there for the enemy to assemble and
attack him. Now they were coming and he was ready.</p>

<p>Cyrus had chosen the battle-ground. He had marched
out of his camp, situated a mile or so down the river,
and had taken position where the narrow plain enabled
him to mass his forces, with the sand-hills to protect his
right, the river his left, and the dry water-course his
front. The enemy, coming down towards him, would
be compressed into an ever narrowing field where their
immense superiority in numbers would not give them
undue advantage. Knowing that the Touranians were
all mounted and were accustomed to charge in mass at
headlong speed, he hoped to draw them into the great
ditch at his front in such confusion that the impetus of
their assault would be broken. For this purpose he
threw out to the east of the ditch about one thousand
paces a curtain of light cavalry, which had orders to draw
an assault, retreat rapidly before it, and take refuge
behind the infantry. The position of the infantry was
a line about halfway down the western slope of the
water-course, and it would not be perceived by the pursuers
until they should arrive at the upper margin of
the eastern slope. Keeping five thousand of his heavy
cavalry, known as the Imperial Guard, in reserve on the
high ground at his extreme left near the river, he had
stationed the remainder, about fifteen thousand strong,
behind the crests of the sand-hills at his extreme right;
and it would be their duty as soon as the Touranians
should join battle, to make a détour to the right, descend
from the hills upon their rear, and there attack. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
by the grace of Ahura-Mazda, Cyrus hoped, the enemy
would be placed between his veteran infantry and his
invincible cavalry, and so be ground to pieces.</p>

<p>Near the margin of the river in front of the army
was a group of men whose dress and demeanor denoted
them leaders. One of these, to whom the others gave
worshipful attention, was mounted on a noble Nisæan
stallion. He was watching the distant mass of enemies
with searching attention. He seemed indeed a king and
worthy to be a King of Kings. Historians and storytellers
have surrounded him with heroic luster. His
countenance was eagle-like. His forehead was high, his
nose sharp and slightly bridged, and his chin firm. The
piercing glance of his black eyes never failed to read
men nor to impress them with the necessity of instant
obedience to orders. His demeanor was humorous and
kind toward friends but fierce and terrible to evil-doers or
to an enemy. Despite his sixty years, forty of which had
been spent in war, his body was erect and soldierly. A
helmet, glittering with gold, was on his head, and from
beneath it his straight gray hair fell to the collar of his
cloak. A white, silky beard covered the lower portion
of his face and lay upon the silver breast-scales of the
flexible coat-of-mail which covered his body and hips.
Brazen greaves, fastened to soft leathern breeches, protected
his limbs. His only weapon was a short sword,
pendent from a belt around his waist. The trappings of
his horse were rich. Its chest and neck were also protected
by link mail.</p>

<p>In the group of officers surrounding the Great King,
there were two of no less royal birth than he. One was
Hystaspis, King of Iran, his cousin, one of the Achæmenides,
the family that had ruled in Iran for ages.
Cyrus had been King of Fars, or Persia, before he became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
King of Kings. Hystaspis had ruled in Bactra,
the ancient seat of the Aryan race. Astyages was king
of Medea and grandfather of Cyrus, whose mother was
a Medean princess. He claimed suzerainty over all
Iran. Cyrus had conquered his grandfather in war and,
having dethroned him, had stepped up into the exalted
position of King of Kings. He had then placed Persia
under control of Hystaspis, who loyally supported him
and acknowledged him as the overlord of all Iran. Cyrus
was a warrior. Hystaspis was a student, a lover of
peace and a mystic, though he ruled his people well as a
statesman and showed qualities of a great warrior when
necessity demanded. In his youthful days he had known
the famous Zoroaster, the seer of Iran, who had reduced
to writing the ancient songs and the ritual of religious
worship of his race and had preached new life into its
creed. Hystaspis was milder, more benevolent, and less
alight with energy than Cyrus.</p>

<p>Prince Darius Hystaspis, son of the King of Iran,
was the other royal person in the group. He had dismounted
from his war-horse and, with folded arms, was
standing at its head, also watching the enemy. Six feet
in height and well-proportioned, youthful and gallant, he
was an ideal soldier. A helmet of gold and silver leaves
covered his black, short-cropped hair save at the temples.
A coat of leaf-mail protected his chest and his
limbs halfway to the knee and was confined at his waist
by a broad leather belt studded with gems set in golden
buttons. A bronze plate further protected his breast,
and greaves of the same metal were fastened to his
leather riding-breeches as a protection to his legs. High-laced
leather shoes encased his feet. A short sword hung
at his belt, and a short-handled battle-ax swung from the
saddle on his horse. A soldier from boyhood and already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
a veteran, having served in Cyrus’ last campaign
against Babylon, yet he was, like his father, a student,
and had learned wisdom of the greatest seer of that age,
Belteshazzer, the Hebrew. His shaven cheeks were fair
and glowing with the health of right living. His eyes
were blue and clear and were set deeply beneath dark
eyebrows and a lofty forehead. He was the idol of all
Aryans, and, next to Cyrus, the hero of the army. He
was commander of the Imperial Guard, and to him had
been entrusted the duty of leading the Guard in the flank
movement by which Cyrus hoped to crush the enemy.</p>

<p>Otanes, a giant in size, the noblest of Iran’s seven
great nobles, was another of the group. He was shield-bearer
to Cyrus and commander of his chosen body-guard.
There was also Hydarnes, another of the seven
nobles, a short, heavy man whose long, upturned mustache
and beetling eyebrows were his most prominent
features. He was commander of the Persian infantry.
Vomisces, one of the seven nobles and commander of the
allied infantry, the Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hebrew
levies, and Gobryas, another one of the seven, a young
man, blood-brother and closest friend of Prince Darius,
were in the group. There was also Prexaspes, a Medean
noble, commander of the light-armed cavalry, a brave,
ambitious man, richly dressed in jeweled armor and having
his hair and whiskers curled and perfumed. He
was a cynical, unscrupulous, and pleasure-loving man, but
energetic, resourceful, and brave. Of him we shall hear
much in this story. A number of orderlies waited near
by to receive and transmit the Great King’s commands.</p>

<p>The herons in the Jaxartes have become restless but
have not yet flown. While they wait and while Cyrus
is watching the enemy, we may study the private soldiers
to whose blows he will owe his victory, if he wins. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
were not of the same quality as those effeminate men
who, in later years, were unable to withstand the Greeks
under the great Alexander. This was true at least of
the Aryans who constituted the bulk of the army.</p>

<p>Passing along the front of the light-armed cavalry, we
observe the dusky Arab, with his curved scimiter and long
javelin, his bow and arrows. He is clothed in turban,
short tunic, loose cloak, brazen breastplate, and leathern
breeches. He is mounted on the beautiful, swift horse
of the desert which he loves as his own brother. Here
also we see famous bowmen from Edom and Canaan,
slingers from the Mediterranean isles, and Syrians from
Mesopotamia, severally arrayed in their national costumes.
When we pass along the lines of infantry, we
note a distinctive army dress. Each soldier wears on his
head a high, round felt cap; on his body, a stout, leathern,
tight-fitting jacket, or tunic, with skirt extending halfway
to the knee, and on his legs linen trousers, confined at the
ankles by the tops of the soft leathern shoes with which
his feet are shod. A bronze breastplate covers his chest,
and bars of the same metal are on his arms and shoulders.
The front rank, as it stands in position, is protected by
wicker shields, covered with heavy leather, braced with
metal bands. These shields are about seven feet long and
are placed upright with the pointed lower ends thrust
into the earth. Behind them, as a wall, the spearmen are
comparatively safe from the enemy’s javelins and arrows.
If the fight comes to close quarters, the shields
may be easily thrown down; then for his further protection,
the soldier must rely on a small, round targe held
in place by straps on his left forearm.</p>

<p>Each heavy-armed infantryman in the six front ranks
carries a heavy spear about seven feet long and a short
sword somewhat like a long dagger. A short-handled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
battle-ax with sharp, shearing blade and pointed beak is
hung by a strap over his shoulder. The soldiers in the
rear ranks, instead of the heavy spear and battle-ax,
carry bundles of light javelins, for casting at short range,
and long bows with sheaths of arrows, for fighting at
long range. Protected by the wicker wall and the
hedge of spears in the fore, they will meet the assault
with showers of darts cast over the front ranks or, advancing
behind the charging spearmen, will gall the
enemy thus before the shock of the hand-to-hand fight
comes.</p>

<p>At intervals along the lines stand the captains of hundreds
and commanders of thousands, distinguished from
private soldiers only by richer armor and plumes of horse-hair
on their caps.</p>

<p>We next note the soldiers of the Imperial Guard. They
are all large men, none of them over forty years of age,
every one of noble birth, and all belong to the military
class of Iran. They know but one calling, that of arms.
All had entered military service at the age of sixteen, had
been enrolled in the Guards at the age of twenty, and will
remain there until they shall reach their fortieth year, at
which time they will either be made civil officers or promoted
and placed in command of companies and divisions
of the imperial armies. Their armor consists of brazen
helmets for their heads, chain-mail for their bodies, and
brazen greaves for their legs and arms. A round shield,
held on the left forearm in battle, will give further protection.
A long, sharp javelin, a sword, and a battle-ax
are their weapons. Their horses are protected by chain-mail
on neck, forehead, and breast.</p>

<p>Cyrus, having satisfied himself that the Touranians
were really coming to battle, turned to his generals and
said: “At last the Touranians have decided to fight!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
We must not only repel this attack but must utterly destroy
them, so that hereafter the terror of our name shall
command peace! Take no prisoners! This day we shall
avenge the wrongs of Iran in the death of its ancient enemies!
Should it happen that I be slain in this battle, my
cousin, the King of Iran, will command. In case he also
should fall, his son, our beloved Prince, will command.”</p>

<p>His piercing black eyes rested a moment upon the
Prince’s countenance. The latter flushed with pleasure at
the honor done him, and bowed in acknowledgment. The
King continued: “The King of Iran will remain at my
side. I shall need his advice. There will be no change
in the plans announced last evening. With the help of
Ahura-Mazda, this day we will fill that torrent-bed with
Touranian dead! You, Prince of Iran, have the most
important duty. Ride down upon their rear as soon as
you see their front ranks engaged with our infantry. Officers,
go to your places! Let the skirmishers advance
farther into the plain!”</p>

<p>The group scattered, each officer riding to his place.
Cyrus and the King of Iran retired across the torrent-bed
to the eminence at the rear of the left wing of the
army. The Prince of Iran mounted and hurried to his
command. Trumpets sounded. The light cavalry of the
skirmish line moved briskly out upon the plain. The Touranians
came on, a vast throng with but little semblance
of order. Their leaders rode in advance at intervals, and
the front ranks only preserved an irregular alignment.
The two opposing forces slowly drew near each other.
The shaggy coats made of hairy skins, the tall, peaked
caps, and the fierce, dark faces of the Touranians soon
became plainly visible to their opponents. The former
were surprised at the apparent weakness of the latter and
began to utter shouts of derision and defiance. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
shouts presently blended into a great roar as the soldiers
demanded of their leaders the right to charge.</p>

<p>But the Touranian leaders were wary. They thought
that but a fraction of the Persian army was here, possibly
an advance guard sent out to delay their progress.
They were puzzled and hesitated. But when the enemy
halted at long bowshot distance and sent a flight of arrows
into their crowded battalions, they lost control of
their men. Screams of agony arose, and a roar of angry
shouts. Another flight of arrows and a third smote the
Touranians. Their own bowmen sought to reply, but
their bows were weak and their arrows fell short. Then
came a vast forward movement of the mass. Leaders
were swallowed up in the midst of galloping squadrons.
The skirmishers of Iran retreated, but turned in their
saddles and shot backwards with fatal effect. Eager to
overtake the flying archers, the Touranians threw caution
to the winds and urged their horses to full speed. The
earth shook with the beat of a million hoofs, and the air
was rent by the terrific volume of savage war-cries. No
line of infantry ever formed could have withstood the
impetus of that charge if unprotected by ditch or wall.</p>

<p>The herons, affrighted, spread their broad wings,
sprang out of the yellow waters of the Jaxartes, and
hastily flapped away. The conflict had begun.</p>

<p>After pausing at the margin of the torrent-bed to send
one last flight of arrows into their pursuers, the skirmishers
of Cyrus quickly descended into and crossed it,
passed through the ranks of the infantry, which opened
to permit their passage, and formed in line on the ridge
beyond. The Touranian leaders were surprised when the
fugitives disappeared from their view in the chasm as if
the earth had swallowed them up, and, guessing the reason,
frantically screamed orders for their men to halt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
But the noise was so great that the orders were unheard.
The shaggy horses of the leading ranks came at full
speed to the margin of the torrent-bed and, unable to halt,
plunged headlong down into it. Many horses and riders
went down and were ridden over, crushed and mangled.
Some retained their footing and struggled across the bottom
of the ditch and up the opposite slope to assault the
Aryan infantry. But the momentum of their rush was
lost. The gleaming hedge of spears, protruding from
behind the wicker shields, was terrible to horse and rider.
The Touranians struck at the spear-points with their
curved scimiters and endeavored to force ways between
them. Masses of horsemen poured into the great ditch
and struggled forward. Pushed on from behind, those in
front could not avoid contact with the darting spears,
which, in the hands of sinewy and practiced veterans,
gashed horse and rider and threw them down in dying,
struggling heaps.</p>

<p>The rear ranks of Cyrus’ army came into action. They
hurled clouds of javelins and arrows over the heads of
the men in front upon the confused mass of assailants.
The slaughter was horrible. But the Touranians in the
front could not retreat had they desired. Those in front
were crowded on, over dead and dying, upon the darting
spears and against the wicker shields, overthrowing the
shields and pushing back the Aryan infantry by sheer
weight. Especially at the extreme left, where Cyrus was
watching the struggle, did this backward movement of
his lines take place. Here the water-course was wider
and shallower than elsewhere and the advance was not so
difficult. Here and there the Touranians succeeded in
getting between the Aryan spears and with fierce strokes
opened ways into the midst of the infantry. The latter,
dropping their spears, fought with battle-ax and sword.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
The contest became a mad swirl of screaming, plunging
horses, shouting men, gleaming swords, and slashing axes.
Heads were crushed, limbs lopped off, bodies hurled
to earth, horses brained and hamstrung. Ever the stout
veterans of Cyrus faced their enemy, unterrified, sweating,
grunting, and cursing, as they stabbed and hewed;
but they were forced back step by step.</p>

<p>Cyrus watched the struggle with anxiety. There
seemed no end to the on-pressing masses of the enemy.
More and yet more poured down into the vale of death
and pushed across to the assault. Javelins and arrows
were becoming exhausted. The infantrymen were fighting
furiously, but were beginning to show weariness.
Casting his eyes often to the distant hills, he presently
noted with satisfaction that the Prince of Iran and his
guards were passing down into the plain at the rear of
the enemy’s left. He then ordered the light-armed cavalry
to the assistance of the infantry at the center and
right, and placing himself at the head of that division of
the Imperial Guard held in reserve, he led it into the affray
just as the infantry, pressed back by sheer weight
of numbers, seemed about to be overwhelmed. The
heavy horsemen of the Guard rode forward smartly and
plunged into the battle. Prodigies of valor were performed.
The infantrymen, seeing their King in their
midst swinging his battle-ax with deadly effect, renewed
their efforts. Huge Otanes with mighty strokes and protecting
shield endeavored to ward off from Cyrus all
blows aimed at him. King Hystaspis of Iran rode along
the battle-lines towards the right. Everywhere the battle
was close, fierce, and deadly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prince of Iran with the Guard rode
down into the plain, and with javelins at rest charged the
Touranians in flank and rear. This soon relieved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
pressure in front. Confusion and terror seized the Touranians.
Those who sought to resist went down before
the shock of the huge Persian horses and the thrust of the
long javelins.</p>

<p>The contest became a slaughter. Thousands of the
luckless Touranians rode into the river, seeking to ford
it and thus escape; but quicksands and treacherous water-holes
swallowed them up or mired them down, so that
they became easy prey to the pursuing archers. The
Aryan infantry assumed the offensive, crossed the torrent-bed,
and drove the Touranians back upon the lances
of the Guard, who in turn hurled them back upon the infantry.
The larger part died. Some broke through and
fled. The noon sun looked down upon heaps of slain
and wounded, upon despairing squads flying over hill and
plain, and upon a river whose waters were red with blood
and choked with bodies. The Aryan victory was complete,
overwhelming, and decisive.</p>

<p>But the victors also suffered. Their loss was heavy in
men, but worst of all they had lost their Great King.
Cyrus at the head of the Guard had ridden into the press
and restored the battle. When the assault on their rear
caused the Touranians to give back, he had followed furiously.
Then an arrow struck him in the neck just above
the collar of his coat-of-mail, inflicting a deep wound.
He reeled from the shock, plucked out the weapon with
his own hands, and then fell fainting from his horse into
the arms of Otanes, who carried him back out of the
battle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>AN OATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE wounded King was tenderly borne to his pavilion
in the camp, and his injury was dressed by
the most skillful surgeons in the army. He was weakened
by loss of blood, however, and suffered much pain.
He became feverish. The surgeons had but little skill in
those days; and the wound was deep and infected. He
suffered the pain with heroic resignation and, after a
while, fell into a restless sleep, in which he tossed about
and muttered continually.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King of Iran, having taken chief command,
pushed the victory to completion and recalled the
troops to their camp from the bloody plain only when the
last enemy had disappeared or died.</p>

<p>Prince Darius and the Imperial Guard pursued the
fugitives as long as they held together in a body, but when
they scattered, some crossing the Jaxartes and others taking
refuge in the southern hills where it was difficult to
follow them with heavy horse, he left further pursuit to
the light-armed cavalry and returned to camp with his
shouting, singing troopers. He did not learn of the
King’s condition until within bowshot of camp, where an
orderly from his father met him bearing the sad news.
At once the shouts and songs of his troopers were turned
to sighs and tears. They entered the camp in silence.
They were dusty, blood-stained, and weary, and their joy
of victory had given place to dejection. The Great King’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
headquarters were in the midst of the camp. The Prince
caused his battalions to form around the pavilion in a
square, with their faces toward it. Then, leaving them
still mounted, he went in to inquire concerning the King’s
condition.</p>

<p>It was almost sundown. The herons, which had fled
away in the morning, were now returning with heavy
wings to the marshes along the river. They did not
alight, however, but hurriedly flapped away when they
found the marshes filled with the dead bodies of men and
horses.</p>

<p>The Prince found the chief captains of the army assembled
in the outer room of the pavilion. His father
was wearily reclining on a couch, while the others stood
near in whispering groups; but he rose as the Prince entered,
and embraced him and kissed his cheeks, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“My son, to the Guard belongs much of the glory of
our great victory. Never have I seen a movement so
well made or a blow struck at more opportune time.
But alas for the Great King! He is sorely wounded and
has a fever. He is now sleeping, but he mutters and
tosses in his sleep.”</p>

<p>“May we go in and see him? The Guard waits anxiously
to hear his condition,” inquired the Prince.</p>

<p>The King of Iran called the chief surgeon out of the
inner room where the wounded monarch lay and, after a
whispered consultation with him, bade his son follow and
went into the inner room with him. The stricken man
lay on a silk-covered couch, apparently asleep, while an
attendant waved a fan above his head. Aroused by their
entrance, the Great King opened his eyes, half-raised himself
upon his elbow, and stared wildly at them. The surgeon
gently sought to repress his movements. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
quickly recognized the King of Iran and the Prince and
smiled as he sank back upon the couch.</p>

<p>The surgeon bowed low before him and exclaimed:
“Let not my lord move! It may open the wound and
cause it to bleed afresh!”</p>

<p>But Cyrus impatiently waved him aside, and said
weakly: “Let be! If I am to die, I die; if I am to live,
I will live! I have had a vision! Draw near, my good
cousin and my beloved Prince! Is the victory complete?
Did many escape?”</p>

<p>The King of Iran answered: “It is your most glorious
victory, O King of Kings! Hundreds of thousands
of dead Touranians testify to the valor of your arms and
the effectiveness of your battle-plans.”</p>

<p>“It is well!” he sighed. “To you, my beloved Prince,
is due the thanks of your King, of the army, of all Iran!
Oh, my heart leaped when I saw the Guard with spears
at rest ride down upon the enemy! It was then that I
rushed into the battle. Now I lie here! So be it! I
know that I am about to die. I have had a vision. Now
I would see the sun set, lest I never see it again. Cause
the curtains to be rolled up. This close air stifles me!”</p>

<p>Servants quickly rolled up the heavy side-curtains of
the pavilion. At a motion of the sufferer the Prince
knelt by his side, placed an arm beneath his shoulders,
and gently raised him. Instantly the Guards, standing at
attention about the tent, uncovered their heads, bowed to
their horses’ necks, and roared out a salute, while tears
streamed down their grimy cheeks and many wept aloud.
The men of Iran were emotional, weeping or laughing
like children as the mood seized them. The Great King
smiled upon them and feebly waved his hand in greeting.
He whispered to the Prince:</p>

<p>“How they love me! It is sweet to die surrounded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
those who love you. Ah, if I might now have my children
here! I would give them a parting blessing and die
in peace. My sweet daughters, Athura, the wise, and
Artistone, my babe! Bardya, my strong Prince, and
Cambyses,— But, lay me down! The sun is setting!
So sets my life!”</p>

<p>“Say not so, my lord!” exclaimed the Prince, his eyes
swimming in tears. “It has been a glorious day!”</p>

<p>“True, my son! And the wrongs of Iran have been
avenged. A nation of warriors has been wiped out. No
more will the Tourans threaten my people. We shall
make this river the boundary of our empire. Fortresses
and cities must be built along it so that never again may
the yellow men of the plains carry desolation south of it.
Advise my sons to this policy. Nay, tell them I have ordered
it so!”</p>

<p>The Great King closed his eyes. The tent-sides were
then dropped. The troopers dismounted and went into
camp, satisfied to have seen the King alive, and praying
to Ahura-Mazda, Giver of Life, that he might recover.
The King of Iran, with uncovered head, stood for a
while looking down upon the sufferer, while his son still
knelt at the side of the couch. Presently Cyrus opened
his eyes and looked intently upon the sad countenance of
the Prince.</p>

<p>“Would that you were my own son, Darius Hystaspis!”
he exclaimed. “I love you well and I know that
you have deserved well of me. Ask of me what you will.
It shall be decreed ere I die!”</p>

<p>The Prince bowed his head till his forehead touched
the King’s hands, which nervously clasped his own strong
right hand between their palms. Then he looked up into
the grave eyes of his father inquiringly. The latter indicated
by a nod that he should speak what was in his
mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“O King of Kings,” he said, “you have been as a
father to me! If I have found favor with you, let my
reward be very great! I ask no less than that you will
give me for my wife your daughter, Athura!”</p>

<p>Cyrus was greatly pleased. He smiled approvingly as
he answered: “Truly you ask much! But not too
much; and you shall have her, if she so wills. I doubt
not that she will gladly consent. She must marry whom
she will. Her mother married me even against her
father’s will and she was ever the light and joy of life to
me. In her love I rejoiced all the days of her life. I
have given her no successor. I go to meet her soon. I
rejoice to call you son. Would that Athura were here
to wed you now! I pledge her to you. Now I have a
request to make of you, and your royal father. I constituted
my son, Cambyses, regent in my absence, that he
might learn to rule. My soul is exceedingly anxious
concerning him. His passions are great; he is violent
and he endures no opposition to his will. He will need
advisers and supporters. My son, Bardya, is of better
nature; he is brave but impulsive. Much have I thought
of them. It will depend upon you two, King and Prince
of Iran, whether the family of Cyrus shall continue to
reign. This I have seen. I ask of you that you will
pledge me your royal oaths that, as long as Cambyses or
Bardya live, you will support them on my throne—Cambyses
first, and Bardya second.”</p>

<p>He ceased. The Prince again looked up to his father,
who had listened attentively and who now spoke without
hesitation: “My son, we are Kings of Iran only. Cyrus,
our cousin, is King of Kings. By his own genius he
has made this great empire. It is his. He conquered it.
He extended his scepter over other peoples. We forfeit
none of our hereditary rights by swearing as he requests.
As for me, I am ready to swear!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“And I also!” added the Prince.</p>

<p>The Great King extended his two hands and took the
right hands of father and son between his palms, saying,
“Is it an oath in the hearing of Ahura-Mazda and His
recording angel?”</p>

<p>“It is an oath!” they solemnly answered.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said the King, releasing them. “May
Shraosha, the swift messenger of God, take those oaths
and register them in heaven! Now I will tell of my
vision. I saw Mount Demavend, and, upon its snowy
summit, I beheld a great eagle. He spread his wings
and, behold! they reached across all the heavens and their
shadow covered the earth. The countenance of the eagle,
Prince Darius, when I closely observed it, was your countenance.
Shall it come to pass that you will overshadow
the world? Or will you spread your protecting wings in
days to come over this empire and by your help shall my
sons reign well? Ahura-Mazda knows! Let his will be
done!”</p>

<p>The King’s weak voice ceased. He closed his eyes.
The Prince and his father remained silent. A rising wind
touched the tent and made it quiver. In the adjacent
room was a low murmur of conversation. After a moment’s
silence the Great King again opened his eyes and
continued:</p>

<p>“Since this empire of mine is new and my will has
been its law, there are no laws by which succession to my
throne may be regulated. By right of birth, Cambyses
should succeed to the supreme power. Yet I am not
happy in him. He is inclined to evil ways and regards
not the customs of our race. He runs after the folly of
the Medes. He seeks the pleasures of Babylon. I have
thought much on this. Perhaps it would be just that he
should be given Medea, Susiana, Babylonia, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
western provinces to rule, since their customs he follows.
Bardya is not so. He loves our ancient customs. To him
I will give supreme rule over Iran and the provinces of
Hind, of Hyrcania, and the Scyths and of all our eastern
conquests; but he shall acknowledge Cambyses as overlord
of the world, aiding him with an army in war, but
undisturbed by him in peace. Thus will I do justly and
satisfy all Iran, whose people love not Cambyses. I will
make a testament and a decree ere I die. Call hither my
scribe. I would relieve my mind of care by making such
decree. Call in the nobles of Iran to hear my will!”</p>

<p>The scribe came. The nobles of Iran entered the
room. They saw the King’s will written down on Egyptian
papyrus. Two copies were made. The King signed
them and impressed thereon his seal. Then, greatly exhausted,
he indicated that he would be alone; and all left
his presence to seek refreshment after the day of toil, and
to discuss the Great King’s last decree.</p>

<p>It was the duty of the Prince, as commander of the Imperial
Guard, to appoint the watches at the King’s pavilion.
Otanes, the King’s shield-bearer and personal
guard, slept in the outer room and stood at the door on
state occasions. There were usually with Otanes several
noble youths who acted as pages or orderlies to the Great
King. But on this night the King of Iran and several others
of the nobility kept silent watch in the outer room,
anxiously consulting the surgeons as they went in and out
upon their ministrations. The Prince, after setting a
double guard around the pavilion, went alone down to the
river and for an hour slowly paced back and forth on the
low bank along the shore. He wished to be alone with his
thoughts.</p>

<p>A violent wind was blowing from the north. The lap
and wash of waves, thrown up by its power, and the rustle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
of reeds and grass, were the only sounds coming to
his ears. The subdued noise of the vast encampment
drifted away behind him as he looked out across the
stream. The moon had not yet appeared. The stars
were dim and hazy behind dust-clouds raised by the great
wind. Alone thus, though thousands of men were near,
while the whispers of the moving air suggested the voices
of those wailing spirits released from their mortal bodies
in this day’s slaughter, the young man reviewed the past
and contemplated uneasily the future.</p>

<p>First in his thoughts, as indeed she had been for years,
was Athura, eldest daughter of Cyrus, known to the
Greek historians as Atossa, the most famous, most beautiful,
and most queenlike woman of her age. He had
loved her from the day when he, a youth of fourteen, and
she, a child of ten years, had first met and played together
in the great park surrounding his father’s palace at Persepolis,
where she had come to visit with her mother, the
queen. She had often been his companion in sports since
the time he had entered the service of the Great King,
as a page. Lately he had not seen her often, as his service
in the Imperial Guard had called him away to the wars.
But, when he had last met her in the ancient city, Bactra,
to which place she had accompanied her father when he
started on this expedition, they had made mutual avowals
of love and pledges of faith, subject to her father’s
consent. Now the expedition was ended. He had the
consent of Cyrus to their marriage. Happiness seemed to
be in store for him.</p>

<p>But the future was not without clouds. Cyrus was
dying. What then? The hate-filled countenance of
Cambyses arose before his mind. The large, square body
of that Prince, the bullet head, the black, dull eye, the fat
face, usually expressive of scorn, he well remembered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
He seemed to hear again the brutal laugh, the bitter gibe
or threat, the coarse words, and the raucous tones of the
Prince, as he had heard them often when as boys they
played together. Cambyses had hated him, apparently
for no other reason than that he could not bully him as
he was accustomed to bully other boys. More than once
they had engaged in personal encounters; and the officers,
who ever guarded the King’s children, had to interfere
and separate them. Some of these combats had arisen
when he had gone to rescue Athura or Bardya from their
brother’s abuse. Cambyses also hated Bardya, whom Cyrus
loved. More than once Cyrus himself had inflicted
corporal punishment upon the elder Prince for abusing his
playmates, and in later years he had often caused him
to be confined in his room as a punishment. If Cyrus
should die, the violent, degraded, drunken Cambyses
would be King, with power absolute of life and death, and
able to wreak vengeance upon the royal brother and sisters,
as he had often sworn he would do, when he should
come into power.</p>

<p>Prince Darius did not fear Cambyses. But if Cambyses
should disregard his father’s will and forbid the
marriage of Darius and Athura, what would be the result?
The Prince involuntarily laid his hand on the hilt
of his sword. Cambyses could be overthrown, since the
people and the army of Iran loved him not; and the
younger Prince Bardya would then reign. Bardya was
a friend of Darius and would approve the marriage. But
to the Prince came the remembrance of his oath to Cyrus.
He had sworn to uphold Cambyses. No matter
what the Prince should do or what wrong he should inflict
upon him or his friends, he must henceforth support
him on his throne! As the possibilities involved in that
oath occurred to his mind, the young man smote his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
hands together and groaned. But he said to himself that
perhaps Cambyses, the King, would be different from
Cambyses, the man. In any event, the nobles of Iran and
the King, his father, would compel Cambyses to give
Athura to him. Cambyses would not dare refuse to regard
his own father’s pledge.</p>

<p>The moon appeared, a dim, pale disk behind a veil of
flying dust. The wind increased in violence. Thin,
broken clouds floated across the sky. The river, vaguely
seen, was filled with choppy waves. The howl of a wolf
came faintly from beyond the stream. A great sadness,
a sense of impending danger, filled the soul of the Prince.</p>

<p>A voice aroused him, saying, “Gracious Prince, the
King has awakened and is calling for you!” It was one
of the King’s pages who thus summoned him. Throwing
off his depression, he followed the youth into the tent,
pausing only at the door to direct the guards to take additional
precautions to prevent the wind from throwing
down the swaying shelter. The King turned a wan, pain-drawn
countenance towards him as he entered and beckoned
him to a low stool at the side of his couch.</p>

<p>“My son,” he said, speaking slowly and with difficulty,
“I am unable to sleep. This wound pains me greatly and
the wind roars about the tent. I am very lonely. I seem
to stand naked and alone before God! I am about to
step out into the dark. I would have you near me. You
have been with me so many years that you are to me as
a son. Now that I have promised my daughter to you,
I have a double claim upon you. Sit here, unless you are
weary and must sleep. It has been a long, hard day, but
a glorious one for Iran!”</p>

<p>“Father, I am not weary,” replied the Prince. “My
heart is heavy for you! I pray God you may recover!
Is the wound so bad, then? Once before you were hurt
in battle and recovered.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“This wound is fatal. It is poisoned. The weapon
that pierced me was unclean. Even now I feel it throb
and burn. I know the symptoms. I have watched many
a dying officer, wounded by unclean darts. But I am at
peace. I have been a man of war all my life; but I have
ever had right with me. I have lived uprightly and
wronged none. Justice has never been sold by me. Oppression
has been rebuked. I have crushed the rulers of
nations to free their people from tyranny and misrule.
I do not fear to die. I am an Aryan. Ahura-Mazda is
God and there is none other! My mind dwells much on
the future, my son. Discourse to me of that. You sat
at the feet of Belteshazzer, the wise, he that was chief
of the college of wisdom in Babylon. He talked to me
often of God and of his own people. I made a decree that
his people should be returned to their home at Jerusalem
and rebuild their temple to God. Call this to my son’s
remembrance, when you go to him, and say to him that
I lay it upon him to obey. What said Belteshazzer of
that which lies beyond death?”</p>

<p>“He taught that the spirit continues to live after the
body dies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, truly, so said he to me! But in that he agrees
with our Zoroaster.”</p>

<p>“He taught much as did the great Master. Indeed, he
agrees that Ahura-Mazda, the Holy One, the Father of
Truth, the Life-Giving Spirit, is but another name for
the same God he worships as Jah, who is the Father
of all spirits and the Giver of Life. He teaches that
there is one God, a loving Father, the Eternal One; and
that in the far-distant past there were but one man and
one woman, from whom sprang all the races of men; and
that all worshiped one God, the Father of all; but that
many of their children have forgotten Him and have wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
away, making Gods of their own imaginings. He
is a mighty prophet and holds communion with messengers
from God and with spirits.”</p>

<p>“I have heard wonderful things of him, how that fire
will not burn him nor wild beasts harm him. What says
Zoroaster of the dying?”</p>

<p>“He taught that Shraosha, the swift messenger,
stands ready to receive the soul and to conduct it over the
bridge that is straight and narrow into paradise, where
the great angel, Bohman, will greet it and say, ‘How
happy art thou who hast come hither from mortality to
immortality!’ Then will the soul enter upon eternal
blessedness.”</p>

<p>“You said that Belteshazzer talks with unseen spirits
and is a mighty prophet. Do not the Magi also call up
the dead and prophesy?”</p>

<p>“They say so, Sire. But Belteshazzer says that they
are liars and that their art is black. He admits that they
may talk with spirits, but accuses them of dealing with
demons and evil spirits. They worship the spirits who
inhabit the dark places of earth and work ill to men.”</p>

<p>The Great King lay silent a moment with closed eyes.
At length, heaving a deep sigh, he said:</p>

<p>“It is all a mystery! But I shall soon know. I am
troubled concerning Cambyses. I have heard that he has
dealings with the Magi and has attended their worship.
God forbid that he should fall into their hands! They
are a vile sect, regarding neither oath nor promise. They
prey upon the weak and superstitious. They would
throw down our ancient laws. I have not been intolerant
of others’ creeds or ever interfered with their religion.
Each nation has continued to worship God in its
own manner, giving obedience to me only in matters of
government. Can it be said that one God is better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the other? How was I to judge the unknown things of
God? But I know that God rules, whether named
Ahura-Mazda, Jah, Merodach, Jove, or Ra. Men know
him not!”</p>

<p>Again he fell silent, with closed eyes and pallid face
turned to the dim light of the lamps which hung from the
ridge-pole by chains, flaring in the currents of air and
swinging to and fro as the tent rocked under the shocks
of the mighty wind.</p>

<p>Rousing himself again, he continued: “I feel that my
spirit will soon depart. When it does, I lay upon you
the task of conveying my body to Pasargadæ, where you
shall deposit it in a suitable tomb. Take half of the
Guard with you. Leave the remainder here with the
King, your father, who must finish the work I have begun
and establish fortresses along this river so that never
again may the Touranians recover the land we have conquered,
or further molest Iran. Let my body be entombed
after the fashion of our fathers. Take a
message to Bardya and say that I have blessed him.
Restrain him with your advice, that he do not rebel and
bring on war with his brother. Take my love and blessing
to Athura and Artistone. Into your care I give
Athura. May long years of happiness be yours! But
I am very weary and I would sleep. Sit here by me.
It is pleasant to know that you are near!”</p>

<p>The King closed his eyes and sank into a stupor. The
Prince bent his head upon his hands and silently wept.
Presently becoming calmer, he sat still in meditation,
listening to the irregular breathing of the sufferer.
After a while he also slept, with his head resting on his
arms, which were folded across his knees. The hours
went by, while the great wind continued to bellow around
and to whip the awnings of the pavilion and while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
life of the Great King slowly flickered out. Darius was
awakened by the surgeons, who, alarmed at the long
silence in the sick-room, had come in to look at the
King.</p>

<p>“Great Cyrus is dead!” he heard one of them say.</p>

<small>PREXASPES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CYRUS, the Great King, had been conquered by a
greater King. The generals and nobles of his army
gathered in solemn council on the day following his
death. The King of Iran presided. On him, as upon
an anchor in a storm, the others depended; and it was in
the hearts of many to declare him successor to the mighty
dead. There was no love in their hearts towards
Cambyses, the heir. His open contempt for their ancient
customs and religion and his erratic and brutal disposition
had not attracted them. The army had given
the throne and his distinctive eminence as King of Kings
to Cyrus; it could give them to another, now that he was
gone, in spite of his expressed will.</p>

<p>At the right hand of the King stood the Prince, his
son, his eyes heavy with sorrow. Otanes, Gobryas,
Hydarnes, Vomisces, and a score of Persians of lesser
note were there; and also Prexaspes, the Mede.</p>

<p>As usual Prexaspes was carefully dressed; he was
ornate in golden, jewel-set armor and half enveloped in
a silken cloak, the famous Medean robe. His hair and
beard were curled and perfumed. He moved with exaggerated
grace and carried his fine head haughtily.
His brothers-in-arms could ill conceal their contempt for
his foppish manners. They were rough, ready men,
straight of look and direct of speech. They loved not an
Aryan who copied the manners of Babylon and Nineveh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and, as they suspected, the vices of those ultra-civilized
peoples. But they knew that Prexaspes was
a brave and able commander of horse and on that account
ignored his manners. He was a fair sample of
the higher classes of Medes, who, residing on the borders
of the more effeminate peoples of the great Mesopotamian
valley, had been infected by their manners and
customs.</p>

<p>The Medes, in the former days, when they had conquered
the lands now occupied by them, had been sturdy,
simple people. Centuries of intercourse with the Assyrians
and Babylonians had materially changed their
qualities and had not only affected their dress and
manner of living, but had injected into their ancient religion,
which was a monotheistic creed, new ideas that
were polytheistic, much to the indignation of their
brethren of Persia and Bactra who still clung to the ancient
faith. The Medes had permitted the fire-worshipers
of the northern provinces to practice their occult arts
and had to some extent adopted those practices. There
had, as a consequence, grown up a priest class of Magi,
or seers, wise men, prophets, who claimed to communicate
with the gods of hill, mountain, and plain, and who
did undeniably work wonders that could not be duplicated
by the priests in the Aryan temples, and thereby
not only discomfited the latter in the eyes of the people,
but impressed the rulers of Medea in their favor.</p>

<p>It was said that Prexaspes was a follower of the Magi,
but on that subject he adroitly avoided conversation.
Cyrus, whose policy had ever been to conciliate those he
conquered, had recognized the military ability of Prexaspes
and had forborne to examine closely into his creed
or his manner of life. In return the latter had given him
faithful service and had been extremely useful in dealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
with the Medean nobility and in recruiting for the
army.</p>

<p>As soon as all who had been bidden were assembled,
the King of Iran addressed them briefly: “I have
called you together to consider the great calamity that
has befallen this army and the empire. Great Cyrus
sleeps with his fathers. The decisive victory of yesterday
resulted thus in greater loss to us than to the enemy.
The command of this army has fallen upon me until a
messenger can be sent to bring orders from Cambyses,
who, by the will of his august father, succeeds to the
throne of the King of Kings. It was the will of Cyrus
that we hold all this country and make the Jaxartes the
future boundary of Iran. It shall be done. We shall
remain here until the enemy shall fully submit, and we
shall build fortresses along this river. On this spot
where great Cyrus departed this life, let us found a city
named in honor of the Great King. It shall be a monument
to his glorious victory and a bulwark of the empire.
What say you?”</p>

<p>He paused. Otanes, upon whom the King’s eyes
rested, answered: “Let it be so! Let the King’s will
be law!” Nods and exclamations of assent came from
the company.</p>

<p>The King continued: “The Great King ordered that
his body be taken to Pasargadæ, there to rest in the
tomb prepared by him and in which rests the body of his
wife. He directed that my son take the Imperial Guard
for an escort and convey his body, when embalmed, to
its resting-place. This shall be done. As for me, I
shall remain here until the frontier be made safe. My
son shall select such of you as he desires to accompany
him on his honorable mission. It will be necessary to
send a special messenger to Cambyses with the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
King’s last decree. He shall travel with the Guard and
my son until he reach Bactra; but then he must go more
swiftly, in order that Cambyses may make fitting preparation
for the funeral of his father. Who will volunteer
for this service?”</p>

<p>Silence fell upon the company. There was no desire
in any of them to greet Cambyses. They would rather
have deposed him. But Prexaspes stood forth and said:
“O King, if it please you, I will bear the message to
Cambyses, the King of Kings.”</p>

<p>The King regarded Prexaspes a moment thoughtfully.
He liked not this man, but he could think of no reason to
deny him. He said:</p>

<p>“You shall go. But swear before us here that you
will faithfully carry to Cambyses this decree and assure
him of our support!”</p>

<p>“I swear!” responded Prexaspes, solemnly, lifting
both hands towards the sun and turning his face to it.
A frown passed over the calm features of the King.
He liked not this exhibition of Mithra worship. But he
made no comment, only saying:</p>

<p>“Say to the Great King, Cambyses, that I, Hystaspis,
King of Iran, have sworn to support him and his brother
on their thrones according to the will of Cyrus; and my
word shall be kept! Advise him also that the ancient
laws and customs in Iran must not be disregarded. His
great father gave heed to them; and on them the Aryan
peoples lay great weight. In their observance will he
gain strength; and the men of Iran will in return dash
to pieces his enemies. Do I not speak truth?”</p>

<p>The speaker’s eyes glanced inquiringly over the company.
The black, sparkling eyes of Prexaspes likewise
swept over it and noted the expression on every countenance.
Nods of approval and unanimous spoken assent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
indicated the sentiment of all. Prexaspes, bowing low
before the King, answered:</p>

<p>“I will exactly report your words, O King! I shall
take great pleasure in assuring the Great King that all
here are his loyal supporters.”</p>

<p>The King was about to dismiss the council, when a
messenger rode up from the east in great haste. He was
from the pickets stationed near the battlefield. The
King waited till he had dismounted and drawn near.</p>

<p>“A message, gracious King, from Captain Mardux
of the scouts!” cried the messenger, bowing low till his
hands touched the earth.</p>

<p>“Speak!” commanded the King.</p>

<p>“The captain is approaching with a company of Touran
princes, who come to the Great King to tender submission.
He has halted at the outer limits of the camp
to await your orders. Shall he slay them or bring them
hither?”</p>

<p>“Bring them hither!”</p>

<p>The messenger again bowed low, backed from the
circle, and sprang on his horse. As soon as he was
gone, the King said:</p>

<p>“It will be best not to inform these men of the death
of Cyrus. No lie need be spoken. But I am the King.
Cyrus is not dead but sleepeth. Send hither an interpreter.”</p>

<p>Gobryas, to whom the last command was spoken, departed
to summon an interpreter. Meanwhile the King
caused a purple-covered chair to be brought out and
placed on a platform made of camp-chests covered with
a costly rug. In this he seated himself, and with his son
at his right hand, Otanes at his left, and the other nobles
near, all dressed in glittering mail and fully armed, he
was ready to receive and impress the coming delegation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
A glittering crown of gold studded with gems, high and
pointed, like the miter of a priest, was placed on his
head. In his hand was a scepter, a silver rod tipped with
a golden pomegranate. Right royal was his aspect; and
the stern countenances of his captains added to the impressiveness
of the scene.</p>

<p>Captain Mardux, a stout, bluff soldier, who had won
his promotion from the ranks by prowess and shrewdness,
presently rode up with a company of cavalry,
escorting five men of swarthy countenance, long-haired,
almond-eyed, mounted on powerful ponies, sitting on
goatskins instead of saddles, and clothed in silken garments
and pointed fur caps. The captain caused them
to dismount and led them before the King, where, in
obedience to an expressive gesture of the captain’s hands,
they threw themselves flat upon the earth in salutation.
Here they lay face-downward while the captain reported
as follows:</p>

<p>“These dogs, O King, came to us with hands in air,
showing themselves unarmed and asked to be taken to
the Great King. I know some words of their language
and so understood that they come as messengers from
the Tourans.”</p>

<p>“It is well, Mardux. Bid them rise to their knees.”</p>

<p>Captain Mardux roused the prostrate men with his toe
and made them assume a kneeling posture. From this
position, they glanced with ferret eyes at the King and
his supporters. They were evidently greatly impressed,
but their sullen countenances exhibited no fear. Gobryas
now appeared with an interpreter, a man of Bactra
who had conducted trading expeditions over the great
plains in more peaceable days. Thereupon the following
colloquy occurred between the King and one of
them:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Who are you and whence come you?”</p>

<p>“We are messengers of the Queen of the Massagetæ.
We come from her encampment, a day’s journey eastward.”</p>

<p>“What seek you?”</p>

<p>“We come to greet the Great King, Cyrus, whose
power even the gods cannot withstand. Behold! our
King is dead on yonder field, and the King’s son is dead.
Our people are broken. The bodies of our slain choke
the great river. Only old men and children are left.
Who can withstand Cyrus? Like the lightning and the
whirlwind he sweeps up from the south! He smites
and men are not! We come to tender unto him a handful
of earth, a broken twig, and a cup of water, and to
ask his pardon, that we may henceforth be his men and
live under the shadow of his arms.”</p>

<p>“Cyrus, the Great King, sleeps and we cannot
awaken him. Behold me, the King of Iran, Hystaspis!
I will receive your tokens of submission.”</p>

<p>“It is well! We know of you, O King of Iran, surnamed
the Just. Have we not heard of your strong arm
and most just and merciful heart? If it be permitted,
we will arise and present to you our tokens of submission,
asking mercy for our remnant of people.”</p>

<p>“It is permitted!”</p>

<p>The men arose. One produced a small casket of
carved wood inlaid with ivory, and opening it so that it
revealed the brown earth of the desert therein, he
solemnly placed it in the outstretched hand of the King.
Another produced a twig of wood plucked from a
stunted oak, and another a small jar of water, which
were solemnly received and passed on to Otanes by the
King, who then said:</p>

<p>“Hear now the King’s sentence! You are pardoned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Enough blood has been shed to atone for past injury.
You are brave men whom the Great King will delight to
own as his children. Your lands and all your property
are forfeit to him, but these he will let you use so long
as you serve him in good faith. But in order that you
may enjoy his protection, it will be necessary for you to
render to him each summer season ten thousand good
horses, as many cattle, and a like number of sheep.
That he may have evidence of your good faith and in
order that your people may be instructed in his laws,
you must send to our city of Bactra each year one hundred
of your most noble youths, to enter the King’s
service, whose lives shall be forfeit should you rebel.
Furthermore, you shall maintain for the King’s service
ten thousand horsemen, fully equipped, who shall march
whither he wills. You shall guard these lands against
all foes. In return for these light services, the power
of the Great King shall be over you, your foes shall be
his foes, and his mighty arm will give you peace. You
shall go out and come in according to your customs, but
you shall molest no man who acknowledges the Great
King as his master. I have spoken!”</p>

<p>The ambassadors bowed themselves to the earth, and
their spokesman replied:</p>

<p>“Let all these conditions be written on tablets, O
Gracious King! Most merciful and gracious is your
heart! Our people will most gladly submit and will
faithfully observe these conditions. And now we beg
that as an earnest of our good intent, we may bring to
you our first offering of ten thousand horses, ten thousand
sheep, and as many cattle, for the use of our Lord
and his army. So may the Great King see that we deal
not with crooked tongues or lying lips.”</p>

<p>“It is so ordered!” assented the King, graciously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“While we have a sufficiency of victuals, fresh meat will
be welcome to the army. The treaty shall be written on
tablets. Go now with Captain Mardux and partake of
refreshments ere you return to your people. Say to
them that we shall build here a great city to be named
the City of Cyrus, and it shall be a place for trade where
they may exchange the product of their herds for the
fruits of the south countries. Let them send laborers
to assist, and the King’s bounty shall be sufficient for
them. But of this we will give you further information
at a future day.”</p>

<p>The ambassadors withdrew, greatly pleased that the
sentence of the King was not more burdensome. A
week later, the required horses, cattle, and sheep were
brought to the camp, and the one hundred youths as
hostages were surrendered. Within a year, the walls of
a city were begun and a colony of loyal Aryans located
within them as the nucleus of an emporium which flourished
there a thousand years, rejoicing in the name of
the Great King who there died for his race.</p>

<p>Meanwhile expert embalmers, who had learned their
art in Egypt, prepared the body of Cyrus for its long
journey to the city of his fathers. When well prepared,
it was enclosed in a heavy casket, placed on a
four-wheeled chariot drawn by ten royal white stallions,
and, encompassed by the Imperial Guard, was
conveyed to its tomb. The great army, drawn up in
two long parallel lines, gave sad farewell to its hero-king
as the funeral car passed along between, escorted
by the Guard; and tears streamed down every Aryan
cheek. To Prince Hystaspis, who led the van, with
Gobryas at his side, a roar of acclamation, a royal
salute, and shouted wishes for a safe journey and quick
return, came from the successive companies he passed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Prexaspes, riding some paces to the rear, noted the
great demonstration and pondered deeply thereon.</p>

<p>All day the funeral car and its splendid escort moved
slowly southward. The Prince of Iran was silent, absorbed
in meditation. Gobryas vainly endeavored to
engage him in conversation. The troopers noted his
downcast mien and whispered together concerning it. It
was well known that Cambyses hated the Prince. Every
soldier in the army had discussed it with his fellow
since the Great King died. All had hoped that King
Hystaspis would claim Cyrus’ throne, his by right of
birth and age, if being descended from an older branch
of the Achæmenian family counted; but they had been
disappointed when the King had announced his support
of Cambyses. What if the Prince could be persuaded
to seize the throne? It was a new throne anyway, this
throne of the King of Kings, the Emperor of many nations.
If he would take it, they would give it to him!
So reasoned the army. King Hystaspis would accede if
the Prince should declare his acceptance. It would be
better to go against Cambyses sword in hand and to contest
for the prize of sovereignty with him, than to be
seized and slain by the madman after submitting to his
sway. All day on the march and much of that night
around their camp-fires, the troopers discussed the
matter. The result of their consultation appeared next
morning. The Prince, after a restless night in which
evil dreams disturbed his slumber when he did succeed
in his efforts to sleep, rose and went forth just as the sun
was rising. He was greatly surprised to see his ten
thousand men drawn up in solid masses, forming a hollow
square around his tent. He was nonplussed when
every cap was hurled into the air, every sword struck
buckler and every head bowed low in salute to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
His face went white with emotion and then became dark
with wrath as he heard the thunderous shout:</p>

<p>“Hail, King of Kings! All hail!”</p>

<p>He raised his hand, beckoning for silence, and, addressing
a group of officers, he said, speaking sternly
and in a loud voice,</p>

<p>“What means this?”</p>

<p>One of the officers advanced a pace, and, bowing low,
said:</p>

<p>“Son of Achæmenes, Cyrus, the Great King, is dead!
Your Father, the illustrious King of Iran, has refused
to take his place. But you have not refused. Now we
know that Cambyses hates you and will do you evil.
He is no Aryan, moreover, and is said to be a madman.
Heed this, our prayer! Let us recognize you as the
King of Kings and our good right arms will make it
so!”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, a roar of assent went up from
ten thousand throats. The soldiers extended their hands
to him in entreaty. Again he beckoned for silence.
When the clamor ceased, he answered:</p>

<p>“What you ask is impossible to grant! As my father
swore to Cyrus, so did I! I am bound by a sacred oath
to the Great King, whose body lies there on its car, but
whose spirit even now, perhaps, hovers near us; and I
must support Cambyses and Bardya on their thrones forever.
My word is given; it shall not return! This
throne is the throne of Cyrus; he set it up and his children
are entitled to it. It is true, the King of Iran by
right of descent might have contested with Cyrus the
throne of Persia; but he had no right to contest with
him that which his mighty arm brought in subjection to
him. As King of Iran, my father is your ruler. I, his
son, am most happy to be your Prince. But Cambyses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
is overlord and such must remain! I have no fear.
Cambyses, the Great King, will not be empowered to do
me harm unless I rebel. You have rebelled. You
know the punishment of treason is death; but I will
pardon you now if you will swear before Ahura-Mazda
to remain faithful to Cambyses, the Great King, so long
as he respects the laws of Iran. Up with your hands
and swear!”</p>

<p>There was a pause. The troopers looked to their
officers and upon each other. A murmur ran through
the great host. Would the Prince yield? They knew
his firmness and his love of truth and that he had never
broken oath or promise. Looking upon his countenance,
sad but set with determination, they decided to obey.
But some wept aloud, and tears flowed down the cheeks
of others. The captains raised their hands, saying:
“We swear, O Prince of Iran! You alone may release
this oath!” And the soldiers repeated solemnly but
without enthusiasm: “We swear, O Prince, and you
alone may release this oath!”</p>

<p>Thus did the Prince of Iran for the sake of an oath
put aside the highest position earth could give. Dismissing
the assembly with a wave of his hand, he turned
in great agitation to enter his tent, that he might regain
that calmness for which in all difficult situations he was
ever noted. As he turned, his eyes met those of Prexaspes,
who occupied a tent near his, and, who, standing
in his tent-door, had been a witness of the whole incident.
He noted on the face of the Mede great astonishment.
He gravely acknowledged the profound bow
with which the latter greeted him and passed into his
tent. Later, on the march that day, the Prince called
Prexaspes to his side, and said to him:</p>

<p>“Lord Prexaspes, you were witness when the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Guard sought my consent to rebel. You are
going in before Cambyses, the King of Kings; and I
place it upon your honor to deal justly with me in this
matter. These men are like children, loving me as I
love them, and thought they were doing me a service.
If you see fit to speak to the King of it, assure him of my
loyalty. Also say that I myself will stand or fall with
these men. No harm must come to them. The King of
Kings shall have loyal service of me and of these as long
as they remain with me.”</p>

<p>“What need to report?” rejoined Prexaspes,
warmly. “Truly it was no light thing your oath required
of you! I marvel that you refused, knowing as
you do how the King of Kings hates you, hates your
friends, hates his brother, who is dear to you, and even
his sister, the lovely Athura! Rest assured that, should
this come to his ears, I will truthfully describe your
actions. How can I forget that day at the crossing of
the Araxes, when my Babylonian archers and I were
surrounded by howling Scythians and we were hard-pressed?
Was it not the Prince of Iran who came with
the Guard to our rescue? I may not be a follower of
Zoroaster, Great Prince, but I am not ungrateful!”</p>

<p>The Prince looked into the eyes of Prexaspes and saw
that he was sincere. “I trust you,” he said. “Let us
hope that Cambyses as King may forget his dislikes as a
man.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>ATHURA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANCIENT Bactra, the mother city of the Aryan
race, was situate in the midst of a beautiful valley
surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges. It was a
fertile valley. Through it rushed the limpid river,
Adirsiah, coming down from the distant snow-capped
mountains in the east and finding an outlet northward
to the Oxus. Though it was summer, the hills were
green and the valley was luxuriant with full-leafed trees
and blooming gardens. It seemed a paradise indeed to
the Prince of Iran and his wayworn guard, marching in
from the arid northern plain. Bactra was a great city.
Many square miles dotted with ruins at this day mutely
tell of its extent. Here the mythical Kaiomur, possibly
a son of Japhet, settled, and planted a race from which
many nations have sprung. It was not a walled city.
The men of Iran relied on their good right arms for defense.
Indeed, they were not accustomed to await invasion;
they invaded others. In the open, with galloping
steed and spear at rest they swept the enemy from
their path, or on foot, with bow and arrow they smote
him or closed with him in close mortal combat with
sword and battle-ax. Their valor made a wall more
potent than stones.</p>

<p>Like a hive did the ancient city nourish myriad lives
and send forth swarms of sturdy men, who, under the
leadership of able men, took with them wives, children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
and goods and forcibly possessed new homes in distant
climes. One stream passed westward to the lower
Caspian and, branching there, flowed northward, westward,
and southward. Hellas, Asia Minor, the Saxon
woods, Scandinavia, and Western Europe received them,
not perhaps in one year or one century, but in successive
years, as successive waves with a rising tide ever encroach
on the shore. Medea and Persia received them.
Ancient records seem to indicate that they dominated
the great valley of the Euphrates and Tigris and even
planted families in Syria on the shores of the Great
Sea; and it is sometimes argued that the ancestors of
Abraham, father of the Hebrews, came from Iran bringing
their knowledge of one God with them. It is at
least true that the monarchs of the Medes and Persians
ever favored the Hebrews and acknowledged their
Jehovah as the same God they themselves worshiped
under the name Ahura-Mazda, or the Life-Giving
Spirit. Another swarm crossed the southern mountains
and occupied India. But eastward and northeastward,
in obedience to some primal instinct that seems to
have driven them in all other directions, the Aryans
never penetrated. The slant-eyed, yellow races, protected
by the vast mountain ranges and desert plains of
Tibet, multiplied in peace on the shores of the Pacific
Ocean and threw out their swarms northward and eastward
into the Americas and the islands of the south
seas. Occasionally their hordes, under the general
designation of Tourans, pressed upon their western
neighbors by way of the plains of Siberia, and later, as
Huns, Turks, and Tartars, succeeded in overpowering,
by weight of vast numbers, the provinces so long protected
by Aryan valor; but not until that valor had been
forgotten in the luxuries of an enervating civilization.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Bactra was at the intersection of main highways of
commerce. Here the great caravan road from Rhages,
to which flowed by different routes the trade of Persia
and Medea, of Egypt, Babylonia, Syria, and Europe,
intersected the roads from India and Tourania. Here
the beautiful wares of Babylon and Nineveh, of Samos
and Damascus, of Egypt and the Ionian cities and of
Greece were exchanged for the fabrics of India and the
products of the northern plains. Here caravans outfitted
for trade in distant lands. The great market-place,
an open square on the shore of the Adirsiah, near
the center of the city, was ever lively with the movement
of men of different colors and wearing as many
different dresses; of camels ever complaining and groaning;
of donkeys, braying; of beautiful horses, exhibiting
their points; and of a thousand vehicles for transporting
goods. Around three sides were dome-roofed
stores, where the wealth of all nations was displayed;,
where gold, silver, precious stones, beautiful earthenwares,
ivory, rugs, weapons, fruits, grains, and wearing
apparel were exhibited for exchange or for sale, and the
noisy shouts of traders were heard the whole day.
Groups of soldiers swaggered along, keeping the peace.
Teachers and priests in long robes walked with solemn
pace contemplative; magistrates and nobles rode through
with lofty aspect; the countryman, then as ever, wandered
about in open-eyed curiosity, loved and respected
by all Aryans, but nevertheless simple-minded and apt
to be cheated; and the humble laborer of the city, rough-spoken
but shrewd, boldly jostled any foreigner who
might cross his path.</p>

<p>The royal palace occupied an eminence sloping down
to the river, near the eastern limits of the city, its stately
walls, and porticos dimly seen through the leafy trees of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the park surrounding it. Other mansions of the rich
and noble, each surrounded by garden or park, clustered
near. The narrow, irregular streets were bordered by
the houses and shops of the commercial class. On the
outskirts, the humbler cottages of the poor were built.
On all sides lay the gardens and fields in which were
raised the vegetables consumed by the vast population.</p>

<p>Couriers had brought to Prince Bardya at Bactra
news of his father’s death. A period of mourning had
been proclaimed. When the funeral car with its guard
drew near the city, a decree was issued and proclaimed
on all the street corners, commanding all to leave their
tasks and to observe a day of special mourning. A
great procession marched out of the city to meet the
dead king. A thousand horsemen, four abreast, led the
way. Prince Bardya, riding a great white horse, rode
alone, with bowed head and sorrowful demeanor. Following
him were two litters, carried on the shoulders of
stout black slaves; these bore the royal daughters of
Cyrus, Athura and Artistone. A thousand or more
nobles, magistrates, travelers of note, and rich men rode
next. Countless multitudes of all classes closed the procession
or traveled along the way through the fields,
eager to see and to hear.</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran, leaving his camp equipage at a
ford of the river a league below the city, advanced
slowly with the funeral car and his ten thousand weary,
wayworn guards, to meet the procession. Coming to an
open field, wherein stood several great oaks, he caused
the funeral car to stop beneath the branches of one of the
trees and massed his guard in an open square around it,
leaving a way open for the royal Prince and his sisters
to approach the bier. Then, accompanied by Gobryas,
he rode on to meet the procession. The advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
guards of Prince Bardya opened to let him pass through,
forming in lines on either side of the way.</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran and Gobryas dismounted as they
were about to meet the son of Cyrus; and the latter likewise
dismounted, and, hastening to them, embraced them
affectionately, while tears dimmed all eyes.</p>

<p>“Hail, dear friends!” was his greeting. “It is pleasant
to meet you even though sadness comes with you.”
He kissed the Prince of Iran and embraced him. “My
sisters are here. Let us go to them,” he then said.</p>

<p>The litters drew near and were placed on the ground
by their brawny carriers. The curtains of the foremost
were parted and from it emerged a young woman,
heavily veiled and dressed in rich but somber clothing.
As her brother and his two friends approached, she drew
aside the veil from her face, and, smiling through tears
upon the Prince of Iran, extended to him her hand. He
bent knee before her and reverently kissed the extended
hand.</p>

<p>“Greeting, Prince of Iran!” she said in a low, sweet
voice, wherein gladness struggled with sadness. “Arise!
Should a Prince of Iran kneel to any person?”</p>

<p>“To one only in the whole world!” was his reply,
arising and looking down into her glorious eyes. “If
I were not here on so sad an errand, this would be my
happiest day. I bring to you the last message of love
and farewell from the King of Kings. His last thoughts
and words were of you and of the little sister here.”</p>

<p>He turned to greet Artistone, who now came forward
from her litter, and gravely bent to kiss the little hand
she gave him.</p>

<p>“Come!” said Bardya, “let us go and greet the dead.
When we return to the palace we shall renew our
acquaintance and you shall tell us all that our beloved
father said.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Without further conversation they walked between
the lines of massed soldiery, who saluted as they passed,
to the funeral car, around which stood a score of officers
with drawn swords as a guard of honor. They ascended
the great car, drew aside the heavy curtains, with which
it was surrounded, and stood in the presence of the dead.
The casket had been partially opened and some of the
wrappings over the face of the remains had been removed,
that they might look again upon the beloved features.
Royalty for the moment was forgotten and the
bereaved children wept; and, in an instant, a great wave
of emotion swept over the vast multitude. Men of all
stations, women of all classes and their children, lifted
up their voices in loud lamentation. The hero, under
whose mighty shadow they had so long rested and been
safe, was no more! Cyrus, the well-beloved, was gone!
Alas and alas! wailed the people. The glowing sun
smiled upon the snowy peaks in the east, the green hills
in the west, and the lovely valley with its rippling stream,
and all nature seemed happy. Only this myriad of
human beings voiced their woe. No greater tribute
could have been given to the mighty dead.</p>

<p>But weeping must have an end. The Prince and his
sisters descended from the car and returned to the palace.
The casket, escorted by the multitudes, was conveyed to
a temple, which stood in the park surrounding the palace,
and was there kept while arrangements were made for
its further transportation to Persia.</p>

<p>Prexaspes, having been given audience by Prince
Bardya, was furnished with an escort and sent on his
way to Cambyses at Hamadan. He was directed to inform
the King of Kings that his brother and sisters
would accompany the body of their father to Pasargadæ.
The determination of Bardya to attend his father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
corpse to its tomb gave the Prince of Iran much concern.
It would place Bardya within the power of King
Cambyses, whose uncertain temper might lead him to
fratricide. Knowing the disposition of Cambyses and
his long-standing hatred towards Bardya, and fearing
that a conflict would inevitably arise over the divided
authority left them by the will of Cyrus, the Prince
sought to persuade Bardya to remain in Bactra, whose
people would protect him. But Bardya would not be
persuaded. He was a bold youth and thought that he
would be as safe among the Persians as among the
Bactrians.</p>

<p>The palace of Bactra was the property of its ancient
line of kings. Here the Kings of Iran were crowned,
and from it went forth all royal decrees. Here King
Hystaspis in early youth had resided with his queen, and
here Darius, their son, had been born. But when Cyrus
of Persia became conqueror of Medea and assumed the
title of King of Kings, he admitted that Persia was a
part of Iran and placed it likewise under the rule of
Hystaspis, but on condition that the latter should acknowledge
him as overlord of all. King Hystaspis
entertained for his great cousin the most lively admiration
and affection. He cared not to dispute with him
world authority. He was a mystic, a lover of learning
and of his fellow-men. He would much rather have sat
at the feet of Zoroaster and delved into the mystery of
life and the greater mystery of death than rule as King.
But he accepted the duties of kingship as a trust for his
people and stoutly protected them from their enemies as
well as in the enjoyment of their ancient rights. He had
accepted the proposition of Cyrus and under him had
ruled all Iran, including Persia. His authority even extended
over Medea in the absence of Cyrus, although,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the capital of Cyrus’ empire being at Hamadan, the
Great King generally regulated the internal affairs of
Medea himself.</p>

<p>King Hystaspis had then built for himself a palace on
the banks of the royal river Pulwar in Persia near where
it flowed into the Araxes and about thirty miles below or
west of Pasargadæ, around which arose a great city
known to history as Persepolis, where in winter he might
enjoy a less rigorous climate than at Bactra. There he
and his queen loved to reside in the midst of a great park,
surrounded by men and women of congenial spirit, embowered
in the flowers and foliage of a semi-tropic vegetation
with the great plain of Merv, a very paradise under
irrigation, lying before them. His provinces were
under the rule of governors. The load of executive duties
fell upon his officers. Only in times of war did he
leave his retreat, except that once each year he returned
to Bactra for some weeks of administrative work.</p>

<p>During the absence of King Hystaspis and his son with
Cyrus on the expedition against the Tourans, Bardya and
his sisters had been guests in the palace at Bactra. This
was a rambling structure, one story in height, adorned
with a portico whose tall stone pillars supported a heavy
wooden roof and gave to its front the appearance of a
temple. The walls of the palace were of roughly hewn
stone, thick and massive. There were many wings, all
gable-roofed and rudely ornate with buttresses and overhanging
eaves. Narrow windows and doors gave light
and air to the interior. It being summer, the windows
were protected by heavy wooden bars only, the winter-time
shutters having been removed. Gauze curtains on
the inside were hung over them, more to exclude insects
than for beauty. The doors were of heavy wood, bound
with brazen bands cut in ornate figures. Inside, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
many rooms were fitted luxuriously, with bright, soft
rugs on the stone floors and with figured draperies on the
walls, where, also, hung armor and weapons. Divans,
couches, chairs, and tables richly upholstered and set
with precious metals and ivory constituted the furniture.
In the midst of the palace was an open court, where a
fountain gushed up from a rocky islet in the middle of a
pool and where flowering shrubs perfumed the air. The
servants’ quarters were at the rear, and, not far away,
was another building where a company of soldiers had
quarters.</p>

<p>The white stone walls of a small temple could be seen
three hundred paces to the west of the palace, in the
midst of great oaks and elms. There had Zoroaster
taught and had exercised the offices of chief priest of
Iran, and there beneath its altar lay buried his saintly
bones. There a corps of priests kept the sacred fire ever
burning and daily uttered prayers for the King and his
people. There, before entering upon any long journey
or going to war, the King of Iran offered his sacrifices and
raised his hands to the Great Life-giving Spirit of
Heaven. There, now, within its sacred portals, reposed
for a time the body of the Great King.</p>

<p>The ground sloped gently northward from the palace
down to the shore of the Adirsiah and was graced with
many large trees. A low stone wall surrounded the palace
park, except where the river bounded its front.
There were benches beneath the elms on the river shore,
where one could sit and look upon the distant northern
mountains or at the rapid stream, rushing in light green
splendor through its narrow, rock-bound channel and
with sighing murmur giving an undertone to the songs
of birds. Here at even came Athura, after having
listened to the chant of the priests, celebrating the close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
of the day as she knelt by her father’s bier. She had
come hither to be alone with her sorrow.</p>

<p>The air was warm and balmy. A cooler breeze was
beginning to blow down from the mountains; it played
with the dark hair above her brow. The scarflike veil,
which commonly served as a head-dress, was thrown
aside and rested on her shoulders, exposing the wavy
mass of hair upon her head and the gem-studded band
that encircled it like a crown. Her tall, well-developed
body was robed in a long mantle of dark, soft fabric,
somewhat like the Grecian robe, caught up in the folds
at the left side so as to expose the tip of a sandaled foot,
and secured by a girdle of golden links at the waist. The
short sleeves of an under jacket covered her arms to the
elbow. Bracelets of gold set with gems graced her
wrists. No pen has ever described her beauty or the
royal grace of her demeanor. Through the dim vista of
the ages comes a picture of dark brown eyes, in the depths
of which shone all the tenderness of womanhood with
its all-embracing sympathy and boundless capacity for
love, and all the fearlessness of a pure, proud spirit, accustomed
to power and authority. Comes also a vision
of a fair complexion, pure Caucasian, or rather Aryan;
a lofty brow, inherited from her father; a profile, now
known as Grecian, but not modern Grecian; an expressive
mouth, where sweetness dwelt, but which could show
firmness and even sternness when necessary; a smile
that would raise a worshiper to heaven; a frown before
which the boldest would falter.</p>

<p>In those days and among that people, woman held high
and honorable place. The servility of the Semitic races,
aped by later Persian rulers, had not yet degraded her.
As in Greece and Rome, where men of kindred blood
dwelt, so among the Iranians, woman held a most honorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
place. Man ruled the world; but his heart was
ruled by a noble woman. Coming of such a race, where
equality made her sex noble, this royal princess exhibited
in her carriage a spirit before which men bowed, not because
she was high-born and of royal lineage, but because
she was a woman.</p>

<p>Of her tradition has spoken much and history little.
All agree that she was the most famous woman of her
age. Some would have her the wife of three kings: of
Cambyses, her brother, of the false Bardya, or Smerdis,
and of Darius, son of Hystaspis. Others declare that
her sister, Artistone, was the wife of the latter. Others,
that Artistone was the ill-fated wife of Cambyses. This
is certain, that she was the high-spirited daughter of
Cyrus, that she was indeed the wife of the greatest of
the Kings of Iran and the mother of a line of kings;
and history indicates that she was the real ruler of the
empire while her son wore the crown. But such history
had not yet been written, when, on this summer
evening, she stood on the shore of the river Adirsiah and
sadly meditated on the pleasant days of her girlhood
spent in the company of her father. Her mother had
died when she was a child of ten years; and, thereafter,
her father had made her his companion, delighting in her
wisdom as much as in her affection. She had traveled
with him as he moved through his great empire, had
played in the ancestral park at Pasargadæ, had ruled his
palace at Susa, had viewed with wonder the mighty walls
and hanging gardens of Babylon, and had dwelt much in
Hamadan, the chief capital of the empire. There rose
in her memory the proud, beautiful face of her mother,
the cruel, sneering countenance of Cambyses, the smiling,
mischievous face of Bardya, the little sister Artistone,
and the grave, kindly father, whose stately manner never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
departed even in the privacy of home-life. Into this
picture of her childhood life there came another face and
form, one that of late years had filled much of her life
with the sweetness of love. She remembered her first
meeting with the Prince of Iran, at Pasargadæ, and how
afterwards as a tall youth of fourteen years he came to
her father’s court to enter his service, and that he talked
much of his mother, of his father, and of his studies.
He had at once assumed a sort of protectorate over Bardya
and herself, interposing often between them and the
cruel elder brother, Cambyses, and even coming to blows
with him in their behalf. With him she had studied, had
learned the art of writing and reading, had sat at the
feet of the great seer of Babylon, Belteshazzer, also
known as Daniel, the Hebrew, and had learned to ride,
to hunt, and to handle arms. She had not neglected the
arts practiced by the women of her race. To cook, to
sew, to spin, to weave wonderful tapestries,—all these she
had learned. Many times, disguised, she and Bardya and
the young Prince of Iran had traveled from place to
place, enjoying adventures among the common people
and sometimes incurring great risks. Then wars had
come, and her brothers and the young Hystaspis had followed
the Great King on his campaigns, that they too
might learn the war-game.</p>

<p>She sat down on a rustic seat beneath a great elm and
with hands folded in her lap gazed dreamily at the swirling
stream, into which the shades of evening were darkly
falling. Bitter-sweet thoughts, the sense of personal loss,
the uncertainty of the future, the near presence of him
she loved,—a hundred passing impressions stirred her
soul. What would Cambyses do, now that he was to be
the King of Kings? She and Bardya had often discussed
the subject. She knew that the proud spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the latter would suffer no oppression from the King.
Would there be civil war? Would brother fight brother?
She feared so, knowing the hatred Cambyses felt towards
Bardya, a feeling that the latter reciprocated.</p>

<p>A footfall startled her. Turning, she beheld the
Prince of Iran coming towards her. She rose with a
smile of welcome and extended her hands to him. How
noble he seemed to her! He had put off his armor, and
over his close-fitting tunic of soft, velvety cloth had
thrown the elegant Medean cloak in common use among
the noble-born. Sandals protected his feet, and the interlaced
thongs with which they were held partially covered
his ankles and legs to the knee, to which the skirt of his
tunic descended. The open folds of the long cloak gave
freedom to his limbs and displayed the broad purple sash
which served as a belt and the golden chain from which
his short sword swung. His head was bare, displaying a
mass of dark hair, slightly curled, and combed back from
his broad brow. He had washed away the stains of
travel. His sun-tanned skin glowed with health. His
eyes were alight with love.</p>

<p>A bulbul broke forth into song in the branches of the
tree above them. The breeze rustled gently amidst the
leaves. The gurgle and rush of the stream rose softly.
A thousand whispering voices seemed to waken all
about, as if the spirits of the woods talked of these two
standing there in close embrace. Love, without which no
human soul desires to live, which raises men to God,
which makes of earth a heaven, which in its all-abounding
strength makes men and women strong, the chief attribute
of God and the chief element in His children,
which links congenial spirits together for eternity and
drives out evil, here sat enthroned.</p>

<p>After the first warm greetings were over, they sat down
side by side on the rustic seat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“I may tell you now,” he said, “that your father gave
consent to our marriage. How I wish you could have
been present so that he could have placed your hand in
mine! Now, if we observe the ancient customs of our
race, your eldest brother must give his consent.”</p>

<p>“But even then we must wait until the days of mourning
for my father are finished!”</p>

<p>“I know, but what if Cambyses does not consent?”</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. This possibility had occurred
to both. The word of Cambyses the Great King
would be law. He might if he willed give his sister to
another.</p>

<p>“That Cambyses is not fit to reign!” she exclaimed
presently. “My father should have decreed Bardya his
successor! Am I, the daughter of Cyrus, to have no
part in this empire? To have no will of my own? Let
the people of Iran answer! What say you?”</p>

<p>The Prince was silent now. The oath sworn to the
dead Cyrus recurred to his mind. It would indeed have
been better had Cyrus willed that Bardya should be his
successor, for then the Aryans would have cheerfully
followed his will. As he replied not, she continued:</p>

<p>“Who, in truth, is entitled to reign in Iran? If birth
gives right, is not the gracious King, your father, this
day entitled to succeed my father? For he is of an older
branch of the Achæmenian family. Let him assert this
right! The men of Iran will uphold him. As for me, I
shall be satisfied to become queen of the world, when you
succeed to your father’s place.”</p>

<p>“Of all these matters have I thought much,” he replied
slowly. “It is true my father is entitled to reign
in Iran; but the empire of Cyrus reaches on every side
beyond the utmost limits of Iran; and it was his by right
of conquest. It is a new empire based on the provinces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of Persia and Medea over which he was always entitled
to reign. Perhaps our ancient customs and laws would
give my father the best right to succeed. But he has
refused to assert that right. He has sworn to Cyrus to
support Cambyses and Bardya on their thrones forever.
I, too, in obedience to my father’s will, when the Great
King lay dying, made solemn oath that I would likewise
support them on their thrones, according to the terms of
his will. Our oaths cannot return. But such oaths do
not take away our ancient right to rule as Kings of Iran.
That we will ever maintain; but not to the overthrow of
Cambyses or of Bardya. I am troubled to know how to
act in the future. Cambyses surely will not permit
Bardya to reign even over part of this empire; and all
the provinces of the East have been given to Bardya
with the sole condition that he acknowledge the overlordship
of Cambyses. If the King of Kings should lead an
army hither to overthrow his brother, we must fight him;
if Bardya seeks to overthrow his brother, we must prevent
him. Alas! the mind of Cyrus must have been affected
so that he could not see clearly! I can see before
us long years of civil war, wherein Aryan will fight
Aryan. Of one thing I am convinced, Bardya should not
accompany the body of his father to Pasargadæ. Here,
in the faithful city of Bactra, with the army of King
Hystaspis at hand, he may be secure. Would it not be
better that you also remain here, while I go to stand before
the King and demand his consent to our marriage?”</p>

<p>“Shall I not honor my father by attending when he
goes to his tomb? I have no fear of Cambyses. Surely
he will attempt no harm to me or to my brother when on
this sacred mission! Besides, will you not also be present?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall be near. Let us hope that the King of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Kings will be gracious. My life shall be between you
and harm. It would be valueless to me without you!”</p>

<p>“And mine would end without you! Have no fear
that Cambyses may give me to another! I, the daughter
of Cyrus, will submit to no such disposition! He dares
not violate the ancient custom which gives a woman the
right to reject one who may be proposed. Not yet do the
slavish laws of the Assyrians have force in Iran. Cambyses
may rage; he may slay me! Yet will he not have
his way with me! Truly if he attempts to oppress
Bardya and me, the people of Iran shall be appealed to;
and I know they will rise!”</p>

<p>He drew his encircling arm closer and sighed deeply.
“Oaths, lives, and crown shall not stand between us!” he
said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>CAMBYSES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME days were given to rest before the Prince of
Iran and his guard, escorting the royal dead and accompanied
by the royal family, marched out of Bactra
on the long journey, over verdant plain and hill, over
rugged mountains and sandy wastes, to Pasargadæ.
Their route lay westward to Rhages, with the Elburz
chain of mountains on the right and the vast deserts of
Iran on the left, thence southward by way of Hamadan.
A caravan accompanied them, bearing provisions and
luxuries for the journey. In spite of the sad errand, it
was a pleasant experience for the Prince and his beloved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prexaspes, riding at courier speed, rushed
on in advance to carry tidings to Cambyses. As he rode,
he formulated plans. He knew Cambyses well,—in fact,
it had been reported to Cyrus that Prexaspes had abetted
his wayward son in his excesses. As much to remove
him from his son as to please the Medes, the King had
taken the powerful noble with him on his expedition
against the Touranians. Prexaspes had not dared demur.
Much as he loved ease and luxury, he was personally
brave and capable. He had performed his duties
and had won the approbation of the just old King.
Knowing the weaknesses of Cambyses, his vanity, his
selfishness, his gross passions, and his superstitious nature,
he now planned how he should gain advantage by
them; and in his mind he saw himself raised to the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
place in the empire, covered with riches, honors, and
power.</p>

<p>He soon arrived at Rhages, an ancient city situated
near that famous pass through the Elburz mountain-chain
known as the Caspian Gates, and not far from Mount
Demavend, around which cluster many legends of ancient
Iran. Here the stream of Aryans had halted many
years before separating into the three branches, one of
which passed northward through the Gates into the Caucasus
and thence into Europe, another westward into the
mountains of Azerbijan, and another southward to Medea
and Persia. But Hamadan, the Ecbatana of the Greeks,
situated farther south, had grown greater and had become
the capital of Medea. Rhages had ceased to be the capital.
It was, however, a great and important city, a base
for the army guarding the Caspian provinces beyond the
great mountain-chain and a market through which flowed
commerce from the sea of the north, the caravans of the
east and south and from the herdsmen of the mountains
in the west. Mount Demavend, magnificent in its snow-capped
grandeur, on whose peak, it was said, God sometimes
rested to view His created world, is one of the
great mountains of earth.</p>

<p>Prexaspes halted here but a day. He sacrificed a horse
at the temple, where the ancient Aryan rites were performed,
and he drank soma and was sprinkled with holy
water afterwards at a Magian shrine, where he left a gift
of money. Having thus satisfied his conscience and invoked
good-luck from all sources, he galloped southward
towards Hamadan, where he expected to find King Cambyses.</p>

<p>The queen city of the empire, celebrated in song and
story, strong in the martial spirit of its people, called
Hamadan by the Persians, Agmetha by the Hebrews,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Ecbatana by the Greeks, sat upon a rolling plain, close to
the foot of Mount Elwend, sometimes called Mount
Orontes. In the center was an eminence on which was
the citadel and around which were seven walls rising in
gradations, each painted a different color from the others.
On the top of the eminence was the far-famed royal
palace, covering acres of ground. Its glittering metal
roof reflected afar the rays of the sun. Its porch columns,
its doors and walls, were plated with precious
metal. Its deep, cool interior was luxuriously furnished
with carved and curiously wrought tables, divans, settees,
and chairs, and with costly tapestries from Srinigar
and rugs and carpets from the looms of Medea. Its
throne room was vast and magnificent. A stone-built
treasury vault occupied one corner, where was stored
untold wealth, gathered during the years of conquest,
when Crœsus and other unlucky kings fell before the
conqueror. A park lay at the rear, inclosed within the
walls.</p>

<p>To this city from east and south caravans, with their
spirited horses, their complaining camels, and their slow-moving
elephants, came, and from the west long trains of
pack mules and slaves, to exchange commodities and to
outfit for new expeditions. Here came armies, returning
from chastisement of some rebel or from conquest of
some nation, to recruit for further forays. Half a million
people, dwelling in wooden, stone, or tent houses,
here made their homes and proudly claimed to be rulers
of the world by virtue of the palace on the hill and the
power of its royal occupant.</p>

<p>It was midsummer. Royalty and nobility, leaving the
lowlands and the heat of the capital city, sought cool retreats
in the mountains. Mount Elwend, whose peak is
capped with eternal snow, thrusts downward vast spurs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
into the plains eastward and southward; and, between
their wooded sides, babbling streams of cool water flow
down from the snows. In the vales and canyons of the
foothills were many tents and rustic cabins, where the
rich and powerful dwelt and enjoyed the cool, sweet air.
Pack-trains fetched provisions and supplies from the
city. In luxury and dissipation, with sport and game, the
elect of earth here passed the time pleasantly. Here
Cambyses was residing, all unconscious that he was now
King of Kings.</p>

<p>Riding down from the north, with a score of soldiers
at his back, Prexaspes saw the dome and towers of the
great palace flash in the afternoon sun and knew that his
mission was almost accomplished. His heart beat high.
He would be the first to greet Cambyses by his new title,
King of Kings, the Great King, and it would depend upon
the mood of Cambyses whether he would be given honors
as the bearer of good tidings, or be disgraced as the
bearer of evil. The guard at his back, picked up at
Rhages, did not know his errand or that Cyrus was dead.
The dark, eagle-like countenance of Prexaspes was impassive
and never betrayed his thoughts. Worn by
weather and hardened by exposure, he now looked more
the soldier than the courier. But he looked forward to
many days of ease and pleasure, when he could discard
his dusty uniform for clean linen, perfumed vestments,
and the elegant Medean cloak.</p>

<p>At a point about two miles north of the city, he met a
train of donkeys led by slaves and under guard of half
a dozen mounted troopers. They were moving slowly
and they insolently neglected to give way to Prexaspes
and his followers when the latter came galloping down
towards them.</p>

<p>“On the King’s business!” shouted Prexaspes, wrathfully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
reining in his foaming steed. “Out of the way,
swine! Offscouring of the earth and filthy jackals! must
we ride over you?”</p>

<p>“We also are on the King’s business!” retorted the
leader of the troopers, a dour, whiskered Mede, bringing
his short spear into position. “By the whiskers of
Merodach! keep a civil tongue and do not try riding over
the train of Cambyses!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes glowered at the speaker a moment. He
recognized the sullen face.</p>

<p>“Ha, Merobates, is it you?” he cried. “I might have
known the captain of the King’s houseguard! Know you
not Prexaspes?”</p>

<p>Anger left the swarthy countenance of Merobates.
He grinned as he answered:</p>

<p>“Truly I remember the Lord Prexaspes! But I did
not suppose you were within a thousand parasangs!
Whence and whither?”</p>

<p>“From the King to the King,” answered Prexaspes,
enigmatically. “But where is he,—Cambyses? I bear
a message to him and must not delay.”</p>

<p>“Wise it is not to delay on his business, indeed!” rejoined
Merobates. “The Prince is now at his summer
camp some parasangs over there,” indicating the slopes
of Elwend. “I am just returning from the city with the
daily provisions for his use.”</p>

<p>“Guide me to him, good Merobates, and great will be
your reward!” said Prexaspes. “In the King’s name, I
command! Leave your men to bring the train and lead
on.”</p>

<p>Merobates hesitated, considering whether it were wiser
to stay with his men and thus assure the performance of
his daily duty or to obey the order of the noble Prexaspes.
But the compelling gaze of the nobleman was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
upon him, and, having issued several gruff orders to his
subordinates, he led the way along a beaten trail into the
hills. As they went, Prexaspes sought information.</p>

<p>“How long has the Prince been at his summer house?”</p>

<p>“Seven days only. He has just married a new wife,
the daughter of Nebuchadezer, Prince of Nineveh, and
he has taken her there, as he says, to be at peace, leaving
his other wives at the palace.”</p>

<p>“Has he many people with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Thirty notables of Nineveh came as an escort
with the new wife. Thirty Medean nobles are with
them for company. Besides, King Crœsus is there and
also the son of Hillel of Damascus. There be the Babylonian
hostages and Gaumata, the chief Magian, and a
hundred others from far and near. A thousand cavalry
guard the camp. Great games have there been! The
Prince has proven himself to be a mighty archer and
spear-thrower. He outshoots them all. Well it is for
them! For the liquor—you know?”</p>

<p>Merobates waved his hand suggestively towards his
mouth as though quaffing from a goblet. Prexaspes
nodded assent.</p>

<p>“How is the Prince’s temper?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Excellent! Never better! His new wife pleases him
and his servants have learned how to avoid crossing him.
But what is this news, which you have galloped from
afar to bring?”</p>

<p>“It is for the Prince’s ears first; but know, O Merobates,
that great fortune either of good or evil hangs over
your head and mine to-day. How does the Prince regard
himself now?”</p>

<p>Merobates laughed.</p>

<p>“He has adopted the customs of the lowlander dogs
who salaam to the earth before royalty. Cambyses has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
forgotten that he is mortal and swears that he will do
even greater deeds than the Great King, his father. If
you would please him, prostrate yourself and bow very
low to the earth. Were he God himself, he could not be
pleased more with adulation and homage! Praise his
deeds—he swells with pride. Fail to praise—you
may as well leap from the tower in the city market!
Please him—a gold chain and a chief place at feasts is
your reward! Displease him,—a bowstring at your
throat, or hanging by your heels to a beam, or some other
evil! Me has he ever commanded to treat him as ever
I have,—with respect and obedience, but not with lying
adulation. I tell him his faults. He laughs.”</p>

<p>“I remember, he used to say that Merobates was his
conscience and was the only man who dared to cross him
or to speak plainly to him.”</p>

<p>“It has always been so. He is violent. He fears not
to smite in wrath; but he is subject to persuasion and
art. He has no patience with those whom he dislikes and
he dislikes all who neglect to praise him. Even the
great Belteshazzer, appointed Governor of this province
by Cyrus, has not escaped his anger. The Prince has revoked
his authority.”</p>

<p>Presently they entered a canyon, in which a clear brook
tumbled over rocks. Following this they soon entered
a small valley. Great trees bordered the margin of the
stream and were scattered over the valley, forming a
natural park. In the midst was the Prince’s palace, a low
structure built of hewn timbers. A score of lesser houses
and many tents stood at the sides of an open field several
acres in extent, which lay in front of the palace. On this
field the sports and contests of which Cambyses was fond
were held.</p>

<p>Prexaspes now perceived a group of men gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
beneath the spreading branches of a great live-oak near
the palace. One, who was seated on a thronelike chair
higher than the others, was engaged in conversation with
another who stood uncovered before him and whose
dress indicated that he was a priest. Others standing
near appeared to be giving close attention. He who was
seated was a large, heavy-limbed man, well-padded with
fat and short-necked and gross. His big, round head
was covered with a mass of curly black hair and was encircled
by a gem-studded coronet. His face was dark,
heavy, and flaccid, but his black eyes looked forth
shrewdly from beneath overhanging brows. Bushy eyebrows
met above his beaklike nose. A heavy black beard
cut to a length of about six inches covered the lower part
of his face. He was a powerful man physically and was
said to be agile and quick in spite of his fat.</p>

<p>Such was Cambyses, elder son of Cyrus. There were
marks of dissipation on his face. From early youth he
had indulged his passions, until now, at the age of thirty
years, he was a slave to them.</p>

<p>The sound of approaching hoofs called the Prince’s attention
to Prexaspes and his followers. He paused in
his discourse and exclaimed angrily: “Who comes? It
must be very important service to cause men to ride thus
into my presence!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes halted at twenty paces’ distance, gave the
reins of his steed to Merobates, sprang to the earth and
drew near, uncovering his head as he advanced. Cambyses
then recognized him and uttered an exclamation of
surprise and pleasure. Prexaspes, throwing himself on
his face at the Prince’s feet, cried: “All hail, King of
Kings! May the Great King of all the World live forever!”</p>

<p>For a moment, Cambyses was silent. He knew the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
meaning of those words. His face paled and he sank
back upon his seat. But recovering he said, in a voice
quivering with excitement: “Rise up, Prexaspes!
What mean you? Why are you here? What of my
father?”</p>

<p>“I will speak only if you bid me, mighty King!”</p>

<p>“Speak on!”</p>

<p>“King Cyrus, the Great King, the immortal hero,
greater than Jemshid, greater than Kaiomur, is no more
alive! But there lives a greater, even Cambyses, King
of Kings, King of the Whole Earth; and, to him bring I
this message at the command of the noble Hystaspis, King
of Iran, thy subject. May I find forgiveness as a bearer
of this evil news of the death of thy father, and favor as
a bearer of the good news of thy accession to the throne!”</p>

<p>Cambyses was again silent, unable fully to realize his
elevation to supreme authority. His eyes turned upon
his courtiers, who forthwith fell on their faces before
him, and cried out: “All hail, King of Kings! Live
forever!”</p>

<p>He drew a deep inspiration. Graciously extending his
hand he motioned to Prexaspes to rise and draw near;
and, taking from his own neck a heavy gold chain, he
placed it around the messenger’s neck, saying:</p>

<p>“I give you my favor, noble Prexaspes! A long and
weary journey have you come to bear me this news; and
you shall be rewarded. That has come to pass which had
to come. Henceforth Cambyses, the Achæmenian, son
of Cyrus, heaven-born, reigns and shall reign! I thank
you, Prexaspes! You shall have room in my palace here
and shall feast this night. On the morrow we will return
to our capital and proclaim my accession to the
throne. Sit down here on my right hand and tell me of
the death of my father. There shall be proclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
throughout the empire forty days of mourning for my
father and, after that, forty days of rejoicing for me.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed weary and travel-stained,” rejoined
Prexaspes, looking down upon his dusty clothes. “I
have ridden day and night, that I might hasten to you. I
pray you command that I may retire and dress as becomes
one who stands in the presence of the King.”</p>

<p>“Mind not the clothes! It pleases me to note such
eagerness in my service. Ho, there, cup-bearer!” cried
the King, turning to a youth who stood waiting near the
palace door. “Bring cups and wine!”</p>

<p>Instantly the cup-bearer clapped his hands. Two
servants came running from the palace, one bearing a jar
of wine, the other a tray of golden goblets. The goblets
were quickly filled with ruby wine and the cup-bearer
presented them to the King, after duly tasting them.
Cambyses took one and handed it to Prexaspes.</p>

<p>“Drink!” he said. “You must be thirsty. But, perhaps,
my father has trained you to soberness?”</p>

<p>“While King Cyrus lived I obeyed him. Now that
Cambyses is King of Kings, I obey him,” answered Prexaspes,
taking the cup.</p>

<p>“Well said!” exclaimed Cambyses, taking a huge goblet.
“Come, let us first pour a libation to the earth and
its gods.”</p>

<p>He poured a little of the wine out upon the earth and
drank the remainder. Prexaspes followed suit. The
King laughed as he looked around upon his courtiers and
saw that their countenances were expressive of curiosity
and mild astonishment. Pouring libations to the gods of
earth was sin with the orthodox Aryans and a new practice
to the majority of those present. But they expected
that Cambyses would disregard custom and law, even
more now as King than he did while only a prince.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Now sit here by me and briefly tell how my father
died and all that happened thereafter,” said the King to
Prexaspes. “Afterwards you shall rest.”</p>

<p>Prexaspes sat down at the King’s right hand on a low
bench. The courtiers and attendants, obeying a motion
of the King’s hand, retired beyond hearing.</p>

<p>“I thank you, O King, for this favor!” answered
Prexaspes. “My last message was written just before
your father encamped with his army on the left bank of
the Jaxartes and two days before the last great battle. It
had been in the King’s mind to cross the river and pursue
the enemy farther when he learned from his scouts and
some prisoners that the Touranians were gathering at a
point ten parasangs above us with the intention of giving
battle. Then the King set his army in battle-array, in a
very strong position, with the left wing resting on the
river and the right far out in shifting sand-dunes. In
front was a deep, narrow water-course beyond which lay
an open plain over which the enemy must come. He
commanded the Prince of Iran to lead the Imperial
Guard to a position behind the sand-dunes, ready to come
out upon the enemy’s flank and rear when the battle
should be joined.”</p>

<p>The King interrupted, exclaiming: “A young man is
Prince Darius to hold so important a command! By my
beard! Infants shall not command under me!”</p>

<p>“Your will is law, O King,” rejoined Prexaspes bowing.
“But I must say that Prince Darius is a most loyal
subject of Cambyses and a very brave and able general.
King Cyrus took position at the left of our army and the
weight of the enemy’s charge fell upon that part. It was
a fearful struggle. My light-armed troopers went out to
draw the enemy to charge and, as commanded, fell back
before the thousands on thousands of shrieking, howling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
foemen. They followed us into the great ditch in our
front and pressed across. They bore back the Persian
and Medean heavy-armed infantry. They broke through
and would have ruined the army, had not King Cyrus at
the head of five thousand men of the Imperial Guard
thrown himself into the breach and held them back by
most mighty exertions! Then came the Prince of Iran
and the remainder of the Guard down from the right
upon the rear of the enemy, crushing and rolling them
back into the Jaxartes. His charge saved the day. It
was magnificent. The light horses of the Touranians
went down like leaves before a gust of wind. But just
as the victory declared for us, the King received a poisoned
dart in his throat and was borne from the field by
the noble Otanes. In spite of all that the surgeons could
do, he died that night.”</p>

<p>“What message did he leave?”</p>

<p>“King Hystaspis was in command of the army. He
called a council of officers and designated me as a messenger
to bring to you the last decree of the Great King.
Here it is.”</p>

<p>Prexaspes drew a packet from a pouch at his belt and
presented it to the King. Cambyses eagerly unbound it
and began to read. A dark frown slowly gathered on his
face. He suddenly cast the paper upon the earth and set
his foot upon it, while his gleaming eyes showed bitter
wrath.</p>

<p>“What!” he exclaimed. “Does he think to divide his
empire and confirm that hair-brained, beardless Bardya
as ruler of Iran and Persia? I say, it shall not be! I am
King of Kings now, and I shall reign alone! I will cut
that young sprout off if he dare claim a shadow of sovereignty!
My father always hated me and loved Bardya.
He always did shield that boy from my wrath. Now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
gives him the best part of the kingdom! What if he does
acknowledge me as overlord? Is he not ambitious? He
will ingratiate himself with the people and then will attempt
to overthrow me! King Hystaspis and his son,—they
doubtless will aid him!”</p>

<p>He rose and paced back and forth, swinging his arms
and smiting his hands together. Prexaspes also rose and,
though standing in a humble attitude, covertly watched the
King.</p>

<p>“What say you?” demanded Cambyses, halting before
Prexaspes.</p>

<p>Prexaspes, after some hesitation, answered: “Doubtless
it was not just in the Great King to make such provisions;
but he was old and very fond of Prince Bardya.
Why allow the decree to be published? There is no need
until you are firmly established. Afterwards there will
be time to deal with the matter.”</p>

<p>The King silently stroked his whiskers a moment considering
the advice. It seemed shrewd and good. His
wrath cooled somewhat. A cunning look came upon his
flushed countenance.</p>

<p>“That is good advice, Prexaspes!” he assented.
“You shall be my chief counselor. This decree shall be
burned. None know its contents but you and I. I
count on your silence and will greatly reward you. If
you deceive me, no death shall be too severe for you!”</p>

<p>“Have no doubt of me, Great King! I am your servant
and will do as you bid. There is no decree. I have
forgotten it. Let it not be seen of men. But Bardya
has a copy of it and the Persian nobles witnessed it.”</p>

<p>He recovered the paper from the earth and restored it
to Cambyses. The latter laughed as he tore it in small
pieces. Calling a servant to bring a brazier of coals, he
placed the fragments upon the embers and watched them
burn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Hark you, Prexaspes!” he then said. “This Bardya
must not be allowed to divide this kingdom. See to it!
Great will be your reward. The second place in the kingdom
shall be yours. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Prexaspes considered a moment. He well understood
the meaning Cambyses sought to convey.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he then said. “Perhaps misfortune
will overtake the young man. Who knows?”</p>

<p>The King laughed harshly. “An accident perhaps!
Rather than that the empire be divided, one of us should
die. The world is not large enough to hold two kings
when Cambyses is one of them! What do you advise?”</p>

<p>Prexaspes thoughtfully contemplated the earth. The
King impatiently waited, glowering at him with the restless,
cruel eyes of a tiger.</p>

<p>“Speak!” commanded the King at length. “Shall we
send a force and take him?”</p>

<p>“If it please you, O King, that I should offer advice,
no. Bardya is strong in the love of the Aryan race. He
now dwells in the midst of hosts of stout men who are
his friends and who would overthrow your throne if they
could for his sake. Persian and Medean soldiers cannot
be compelled to make war upon Bactrians when led by a
son of Cyrus. Babylon, Assyria, Damascus, Sardis, and
the Ionian cities will not uphold your hands; they but
wait for an opportunity to rebel. You must court the
favor of the Aryan race. Above all I advise that you
show favor to the King of Iran and to his able son. They
are the idols of the veteran army of Cyrus.”</p>

<p>“But Darius is Bardya’s friend!”</p>

<p>“True, but he is also your loyal supporter.”</p>

<p>“How know you? Is it not said openly among the
nobles of Persia that Hystaspis by right of birth should
have ruled instead of Cyrus? Darius is ambitious. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
know that youth! I have hated him since my father
showed more favor to him and to Bardya than to me!
He knows this. How then say you he will be my supporter?”</p>

<p>“Do you not remember his love of truth and his hatred
of lies and deception from his boyhood up?”</p>

<p>“I remember! No doubt it was a disease in him!”</p>

<p>“Just so! Nevertheless it is said throughout Persia
and Iran and by every man of the great army, that, when
once the word of the Prince of Iran is given, it will stand
forever. No one ever requires of him a witness or a
written tablet. Now at the request of Cyrus and with
consent of his father, he placed his hands in those of the
Great King and swore to support you and Bardya on the
throne of this empire. Therefore you need not fear him;
but, rather, you may depend upon him for aid if you need
it.”</p>

<p>The cloud on the King’s face lifted somewhat. He had
watched with jealous eye the growing power of the young
Hystaspis and had feared him even more than Bardya.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, wait till his ambition meets opportunity,”
he suggested.</p>

<p>“No, it is as I say. I have proof. On the march to
Bactra, the Prince with the Imperial Guard was in charge
of the transport of the King’s body. The Guard, on the
morning of the second day’s march, saluted Darius as
King of Kings; and all had taken oath to support him if
he would consent. But he rebuked them, told them of his
oath to support you, and then and there made them also
swear with uplifted hands to support you. I myself witnessed
it.”</p>

<p>“Is it so? Treason must be flourishing indeed!” exclaimed
Cambyses, bitterly. “This Guard shall no longer
be the Imperial Guard! It shall be decimated!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Rage again possessed the King’s soul. He knew himself
to be unpopular save with a few boon companions.
His jealous heart was filled with hatred towards the popular
Prince. Prexaspes ventured to remonstrate.</p>

<p>“Let not the Great King be offended with his servant!
I am acquainted with the army and all its soldiers. The
Aryans are a proud race and the nobles will not bow the
knee even to their kings, as you know. Do not anger
them. Without them your subject nations will revolt and
you will have no one to support your empire. Rather,
dissemble your feelings. You are very wise, O King, if
you but stop to think. First, be well established on your
throne. After the body of your heroic father shall have
been placed in its tomb, send the Prince and his Guard to
conquer new provinces. Be advised by me in this.
Should evil befall his son, old Hystaspis would lead the
veterans of Cyrus five hundred thousand strong against
you. Who could stand before them?”</p>

<p>Cambyses ceased pacing back and forth and sat down,
saying: “Your words are wise, Prexaspes. I will be
advised. Proceed!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes smiled slightly behind his hand. He had
properly gauged the King’s impulses. He continued:
“I advise that you issue your formal decree as King of
Kings to-morrow and send copies thereof to be proclaimed
in every province of the empire; that you issue a
decree confirming the Prince of Iran in command of the
Guard and in his mission to transport the body of the
Great King to Pasargadæ; that you send a messenger to
Bardya and to your sisters greeting them kindly; that
you, also, as soon as they shall have arrived at Hamadan,
show them all honor, go with them to do honor to Cyrus
at Pasargadæ, and dissemble your real feelings. Thus
will you begin wisely and thus will you please the Aryan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
people. Afterwards we may take counsel; and, should
Bardya meet with an accident or disappear, who can
blame the Great King? Be assured, O King, that I advise
well! I know that upon you only may I depend for
advancement and power. Bardya does not, nor do any
of the great Persian nobles, love Prexaspes. Their semi-barbaric
manners suited not my taste, and my refined
manners were not approved by them!”</p>

<p>“I will heed your advice,” said the King. “My favor
shall be with you. First, I will make you Satrap of
Medea. I will let that old Hebrew, Belteshazzer, rest
from his labors in his tower. Afterwards, if you serve
me well, I shall increase your power. See to it, Prexaspes,
that my will be not thwarted! There shall be one
King, who shall be King of Kings, and he must be Cambyses!”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you wish. But let us proceed with all
care.” Thus Prexaspes entered upon a road to great
gain in wealth and power, but also to ultimate woe.</p>

<p>The King presently dismissed Prexaspes, and the latter
was conducted to pleasant rooms in the palace, where he
refreshed himself with a bath, arrayed himself in clean
linen and rich garments and had himself barbered and
perfumed by the King’s own barbers. Cambyses was
lavish with his favorites, and just now Prexaspes was
chief of them. The latter sat at the King’s right hand at
dinner that evening. All festivities were abandoned in
honor of the dead King, but the many courtiers who ate
at his tables found opportunity to assure the new King
of their joy over his accession to the throne. He drank
deeply both of adulation and wine until he became half-drunk
and maudlin, whereupon Merobates took him almost
forcibly to his bedchamber.</p>

<p>Next day, the King and all his retinue returned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Hamadan. A royal decree was immediately issued, reciting
the death of the Great Cyrus and the accession of
Cambyses to the throne of the world, and commanding all
officers, soldiers, and peoples to acknowledge him King of
Kings. The royal treasury was opened. From it the
golden crown studded with precious gems, which Cyrus
had worn on state occasions, and the royal scepter were
brought forth. Clad in purple, and having the high,
pointed crown on his head, his royal feet encased in yellow
shoes, and his hair and whiskers curled, powdered,
and perfumed, Cambyses held his first court in the great
audience room of the palace. He sat on a golden throne
placed high up on a dais, with fan-bearers waving ostrich
plumes over him, with Prexaspes standing at his right
hand and Merobates at his left, bearing the King’s sword
and shield. He placed the crown on his head with his
own hands, while a loud-voiced herald recited his titles.
Then the thousand nobles and officers who were in attendance
fell on their faces to the floor before him and
hailed him King of Kings, the Great King! Cambyses,
swelling with pride, deemed himself divine, and as a god
he looked down upon his subjects with haughty demeanor.</p>

<p>The world thus acquired a new ruler.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>PERSEPOLIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE modern world knows little of the beauty and
grandeur of ancient Anshan, the home of Cyrus, or
of the province of Fars and its cities. Mountains shut
off from them the hot winds of the Persian Gulf and of
the northern deserts. The high valleys lying between
the mountain ranges that extend across it like huge dikes
are of surpassing loveliness. Romantic woodlands, dells,
lakes, canyons, murmuring brooks, rushing rivers, far
vistas, plains, mountains, and hills delight the soul. In
the valleys, flowers perfume the air all the year, and vegetation,
where irrigation is practiced, is luxuriant. On
the high hills and mountain tops winter holds sway during
three or more months and the seasons are well-marked
as in the temperate zones. It is the land of
Omar, of Firdusi, and of many lesser poets; the land of
an ancient white race, whose rugged virtues made them
lords of much of the earth, but whose descendants have
degenerated by admixture with lower grades of humanity
and have suffered much to maintain even their own independence.</p>

<p>The celebrated plain of Mervdasht is between two
parallel ranges of mountains, one of which lies to the
west between it and the low hot lands of the gulf-coast
and the other to the east between it and the vale of
Murghab, or ancient Anshan. A river comes down from
the northern mountains through the midst of this plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and empties into a lake. It is a perennial stream, but
fordable save in the winter when the rains fall. It has
been variously named, anciently the Araxes, later the
Kur or river of Cyrus, and again the Bendamir. Another
river of less volume but more celebrated, the
Pulwar, comes down to join it through the mountains
from northeast table-lands. This passes by the vale of
Murghab, where a little stream of that name, coming from
the east, flows into it. In this vale was ancient Anshan,
the capital of the Achæmenian line of kings, a city also
known as Pasargadæ. The tortuous bed of the Pulwar
connects the vale of Murghab with the valley of Mervdasht,
having cut for itself a deep gorge through the
mountains. A royal road, passing through this gorge or
canyon, connected the ancient capital with a more modern
city, Persepolis.</p>

<p>Persepolis, or the city of the Persians, ancient Parsa,
lay close to the mouth of the mighty canyon of the Pulwar,
where it opened into the vale of Mervdasht. The
city lay principally on the northern banks of the river.
On the southern bank was a great park; and in this on a
plateau extending from the base of low mountains that
border the eastern side of the plain, were the palaces of
the Kings of Iran. King Hystaspis and his great son,
Darius, and his grandson, Xerxes, each erected magnificent
palaces of dark-gray marble on this natural platform.
The great size and magnificent architecture of
these buildings were among the wonders of the ancient
world. Their majestic ruins yet testify to the power, the
love of art, and the learning of those masters of men.</p>

<p>King Hystaspis, content to rule Iran as a nominal
vassal of Cyrus and under the shadow of his mighty arm,
laid out for himself in the valley of Merv a new city and
there placed his loved friends and retainers. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
brought artisans from Egypt, Canaan, Syria, Phœnicia,
and distant Greece, and built for himself a great palace.
It is said that he or his son formulated a new alphabet
for his language and caused the books of Zoroaster to be
translated therein.</p>

<p>Orchards of apple, peach, and apricot, vineyards
where grape and berry grew, fields of vegetables and
grain, covered the fertile valley and its surrounding hills.
On the day when the Imperial Guard, escorting the body
of the Great Cyrus, halted on the summit of the western
ridge bounding the valley and looked down upon the
peaceful scene, autumn was touching all with the signs
of harvest and the coming winter-rest. On that day,
while the funeral car halted, Prince Bardya, his sisters,
and the Prince of Iran rode forward to a bluff jutting
out from the ridge; and from this position they looked
down into a paradise,—so it seemed to them, weary with
dusty roads and desert lands. There, where the Pulwar
entered the plain from the narrow gorge in the western
mountains, Cyrus had drawn up his Persian patriots to
fight a last battle for liberty from the Medean yoke, having
been driven to bay by the vast army of stern old
Astyages, his grandfather. That decisive battle not only
gave liberty to his own province but gave Astyages to
him as a prisoner and the crown of Medea for his own
head. From that victory Cyrus had gone forth to conquer
the world. But now, conquered by the last enemy,
Death, he was returning there to his final rest. The
heart of the Prince of Iran was stirred by strong emotions,
as he looked across the beautiful vale. He could
see afar the great portico of his father’s palace where, he
knew, his mother stood watching for the coming of her
son. Uncovering his head, he extended his hands towards
heaven, saying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“To thee, O Ahura-Mazda, Ruler of Heaven, Giver of
Life, Lover of Truth, and Protector, we give thanks!
For thou hast brought us home!”</p>

<p>“Amen and amen!” exclaimed Bardya, uncovering his
head.</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran then addressed his companions:
“I welcome you to the home of King Hystaspis. This
valley and yonder city are his property, ceded to him as a
home for the Achæmenian family, when he consented to
remove hither from Bactra. I bid you rest at our palace
yonder this night. The road from Parsa to Anshan is
rough and ought to be traveled only by day. My mother
is at the door to welcome you.”</p>

<p>“We gladly accept!” assented Bardya, heartily. “Do
I not love that mother almost as much as you? Do you
remember the happy days when we hunted on yonder
hills and swam in the Pulwar and the Araxes? Do you
remember the day we were almost drowned? We will
go to that deep water-hole again to-morrow and swim
there as boys again. Our troopers should rest a day
while we send a message to Cambyses at Anshan to
inform him of our coming.”</p>

<p>Athura added: “It will be delightful to accept the
hospitality of your mother. I shall return after going
to Anshan and shall stay long with her and rest. My
sister is much in need of rest. The long journey has
made her ill.”</p>

<p>“After we shall have accomplished our mission,” said
the Prince of Iran, “we shall enjoy many pleasant days
there. The hunting is good. We shall enjoy the royal
sport!”</p>

<p>“Unless Ahriman interfere!” added Bardya, waving
his hand towards Anshan, where his brother now
awaited their coming. “I propose to stay a month at
least. I suppose he awaits us impatiently at Anshan.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Athura said reprovingly to her brother: “Speak not
of the King of Kings thus! He has sent us courteous
messages, even if he would not await us at Hamadan
or march with us here. Perhaps it was best that he
should go on ahead to prepare the tomb and to arrange
for the ceremonies. Be advised, brother! Remember
to show him the deference due to his station. His
anger was ever terrible! Now he has no one to restrain
him.”</p>

<p>Bardya laughed and tossed his head, as he answered:
“Fear not for me! I shall treat him with all due respect.
Am I not on the ground my father gave me in
his will? The Persian lords will not permit him to
oppress us. When I see that King of Kings, I will demand
of him that he publish the full terms of my
father’s will. If he refuse to observe that—Well, it
may be that he will cease to reign!”</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran said nothing, but his countenance
was somber. He feared that the impetuous Bardya
would precipitate trouble. He foresaw civil war.</p>

<p>Descending into the valley, they approached Persepolis.
A vast throng of people came out to meet them
and stood on either side of the road weeping and wailing
aloud as the funeral car passed. A company of guards
led by an aged veteran met them at the entrance of the
city.</p>

<p>Prince Darius greeted the leader warmly: “Ho,
Orobates, our beloved High Chamberlain! How fares
my royal mother?”</p>

<p>“All hail, Prince of Iran!” cried the stately old man,
kissing the Prince’s cheeks as the latter bent down to
greet him. “God’s blessing of long life and happiness
be upon you! How good it is to behold you once more!
Your mother, our most gracious Queen, is well and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
awaits you at the palace. She begs that you will prevail
upon the royal Bardya and his sisters to honor her house
with their presence. All things are prepared. The best
of the herds, the finest game from the mountains, the
daintiest fruits and flowers,—all are ready!”</p>

<p>“They have consented to honor us, Orobates. Has
my mother good health and is she happy?”</p>

<p>“Excellent health, gracious Prince; but she sighs much
for you and the King.”</p>

<p>“Did Cambyses, the Great King, honor our house with
his presence?”</p>

<p>“He refused our bidding on the plea that he was in
haste to reach Anshan on state business. But he sent
a gracious greeting to your mother.”</p>

<p>The Prince led the caravan into the city, nodding and
waving greeting to many whom he had known when a
child. Crossing the Araxes over a magnificent stone
bridge, the cortège marched into Persepolis and encamped
in a great open field on the shore of the Pulwar.
The funeral car was driven into the sacred enclosing wall
of a temple and there rested till a messenger went to
Cambyses and returned.</p>

<p>Leaving the cares of the encampment to subordinates,
the Prince of Iran, accompanied by Gobryas and some of
his chief officers, conducted Bardya and his sisters across
the Pulwar over a beautiful stone bridge of one great
arch and through the park to his father’s palace. The
limpid stream, the great oaks, elms, walnuts, and plane
trees, whose foliage was tinged with gold and red, the
flowering shrubs, the fountains, and the greensward,
smiled a joyful welcome to the weary travelers. Broad
steps, leading up to the great plateau or bench on which
the palace stood, gleamed white through the tree-limbs.
Slender gray columns adorned the portico. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
stairs stood a group of women, and among them a stately
dame, who waved her hand in welcome. Prince Darius
galloped on ahead to the foot of the steps and, leaving
his horse in charge of an attendant, ran up into the embrace
of his mother.</p>

<p>Age had not greatly affected the beauty of the Queen
of Iran nor dimmed her blue eyes. Her gray hair was
gathered in a net at the back of her head and was encircled
by a golden band set with sparkling gems. Her
dress was an ample purple robe reaching to her feet and
encircled at the waist with a silken sash. Its loose sleeves
revealed arms still shapely and adorned with bracelets
of gold. The gracious majesty of her countenance, the
sweetness of her smile, and the soft accents of her voice
were celebrated in Iran.</p>

<p>That was an age when wife and mother were not
slaves or prisoners. Recognized as the equal of men,
their virtues and loveliness made homes where men were
grown. Not yet had Cambyses, aping the manners and
customs of the dwellers in Mesopotamia, Syria, and
Arabia, degraded women to the seclusion of harems; nor
had custom forbidden women to appear before friends
unveiled, though veils were commonly worn in public
places. Polygamy was almost unknown in Iran, though
its practice had crept into Medea. The wife was queen
of the home and ruled in the heart of her husband.</p>

<p>The Prince knelt at his mother’s feet, and her arms
encircled his neck while her lips kissed his brow. “Welcome
home, beloved son!” she exclaimed. “Long days
have intervened since you waved farewell to me from
yonder bridge; but no day has passed that I did not
think of you!”</p>

<p>She raised him up and stood proudly at his side, leaning
on his arm, while she welcomed Prince Bardya and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
his sisters. To Bardya she said as he bent his knee
before her: “The blessing of Ahura-Mazda be upon
you, O Prince of the World! Arise! It is not meet
that you kneel to me! Welcome to the palace of my
lord, the King of Iran!”</p>

<p>“Gracious Queen,” replied Bardya as he arose, “I
kneel to you as to my mother! Next to her, who lives
only in my memory, do I love and reverence the mother
of my friend, the Prince of Iran. Have we not, in
years past, stood together at your knee and received
your instruction? Now that we are indeed orphans we
come to you for consolation.”</p>

<p>Tears filled the great lady’s eyes. She embraced
Athura and Artistone tenderly; and, leaving the men to
the care of her son, she took the girls with her to her
own apartments and personally saw that they were made
comfortable. While they are removing the dust of the
road and enrobing themselves for dinner, we may wander
in spirit through this typical palace of the Achæmenian
kings and observe its grandeur.</p>

<p>From the portico which extended the full breadth of
the palace front, an entrancing view of valley and mountain,
of river and park, could be had. Sixteen slender,
fluted, marble pillars supported the massive wooden roof
of the portico. Their capitals were winged bulls; their
bases were bell-shaped and carved to imitate lotus buds.
A high, narrow door gave entrance from the front
through the thick stone walls into a hall, on either side
of which were rooms where the palace-guards had their
abode. The hall led into a reception room fully fifty
feet square, whose walls were pierced by a dozen narrow
windows and whose ceiling of heavy carved timbers was
upheld by slender wooden pillars covered with silver
plates. The stone walls were hidden by beaten silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
plates and the windows and doors were hung with
tapestries of fine crimson and purple fabrics. Wooden
shutters were fitted to the windows, but were now open
to admit air and light. Later, when winter should come
with its rains and frost, the windows would be closed
by semi-transparent oiled silk. Red and purple rugs lay
on the tiled floor, partially covering the various patterns
worked out in colored tiles. A throne, shining with
gold plate, occupied a raised platform at the end of the
room opposite the entrance. Cushioned chairs, divans,
and couches, tables of polished wood, mirrors of polished
silver and bronze, lamps of many patterns fastened to
the pillars and walls, and a cabinet of dark inlaid wood
comprised the furniture. The cabinet held a collection
of books, rolls, and tablets, the library and the special
treasure of the King of Iran.</p>

<p>Doors at the right of the throne led into the apartments
of the men; at the left, into the apartments of the women;
and, immediately at the rear, into a small open court,
beyond which were the servants’ quarters. Banquets of
state were held in the throne room, but ordinarily the
tables were laid in the small open court. The various
apartments were furnished with couches, and with blankets
and rugs of skillful weaving and of that fineness
and texture for which the woven products of Iran have
ever been famous. All the conveniences of an advanced
civilization, which power and wealth could provide or
gather from the many nations over which the Persians
held sway, were here. Baths and toilets fed by water
piped from the hills, and drained into the Pulwar below,
ornamental cabinets, containing scents and cosmetics for
adorning the person, wardrobes full of costly dresses
made of silk and fine linen, mirrors, combs, and brushes—even
the modern homes of many so-called civilized
people could boast no better.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>A narrow stair led up from the inner court to the
flat roof, where the occupants of the palace, reclining
on soft divans, under canopies or sunshades, could pass
the warmer hours of the day, breathe the cool mountain
air, and enjoy the lovely scenes. Looking down from
it, one could see the royal stables five hundred paces to
the south in the park, where scores of graceful horses
were kept; and farther on was the inclosure where cattle
and sheep, driven in from the mountain pastures, were
ready to furnish the royal table with meat or milk. A
canal led from the Pulwar above the palace through the
park to the stables below and thence into luxuriant
gardens where servants toiled to supply their master’s
table with vegetables. Fowls, dogs, horses, and cattle
enlivened the barnyard scene. Servants in gay tunics,
loose, fringed trousers, and with sandaled feet went
hither and thither on their duties. Guards in shining
armor walked their beats through the park or lazily
stood leaning on their spears at the palace steps.</p>

<p>While the guests were removing the dust and stains
of travel, servants busily prepared the banquet. Tables
of walnut, plated with silver and bound together by
golden bands fastened with copper nails, were set in the
great audience hall. Platters of beautiful porcelain or
of beaten silver, piled high with fruits and bread, were
placed on them, and plates of silver and cups of gold
were also brought forth. Low seats whereon the guests
could either sit or recline were set in order. A major-domo
in gorgeous livery saw that all things were made
ready. Then the guests were called. The men were
seated at one table; the women, at another. Prince
Darius sat at the head of the former; his mother at the
head of the latter. Servants brought on, in regular
courses, fish, steaming loads of venison and fowl, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
bountiful supplies of vegetables and pastry. Water,
milk, and wine of Helbon were the drinks, the latter
being used sparingly. With appetites sharpened by a
long day’s journey in the bracing air of the mountains,
the guests did full justice to the viands. While they
ate, the soft music of harps, played with considerable
skill by musicians in the court, floated in through the
open doors.</p>

<p>The banquet hour having passed, the officers and
nobles returned to the camp, while Prince Bardya and
his sisters accompanied Prince Darius and his mother
to a room adjacent to the dining-hall, used by the King
of Iran when at home as an office. A large fireplace
in one corner of the room was filled with a cheerful
blaze. Gathered about the fire, guests and hosts felt
much at home and spent a pleasant hour in conversation.</p>

<p>“Now that Cambyses passed through your city with
scant courtesy,” Bardya said, somewhat warmed by the
wine he had imbibed and by his genial surroundings, so
that he felt called upon to express his indignation towards
his brother, “what think you of such a king?”
He addressed Queen Hystaspis.</p>

<p>“I marvel not at his action,” she replied quietly. “He
was never kindly disposed towards us. But it is not
for us to find fault. I should have met him in person
and given the invitation to stop with us. I would have
so done, had I not heard that he believes, with the Medes,
that women have no place in the affairs of men. He
passed through our city in a closed litter, not even deigning
to see our messengers. He made reply through
his chamberlain that the King of Kings was indisposed
and pressed for time and would not rest till he should
arrive at his palace in Anshan.”</p>

<p>“He has ever been ill-natured!” continued Bardya,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
bitterly. “He believes himself heaven-born! He will
end by declaring himself a god and appointing set times
to worship him! What think you the nobles of Persia
will say of his manners? It is said he has determined
to decree a law of polygamy, and, like the Arabs,
fill a harem with many wives. He is a follower of the
Magi; but I doubt if he believes in the gods. I know
he will never abide by our father’s will. As I have
ridden from Bactra hither, I have thought much; and
I have concluded that the kingdom will be his who can
strike first!”</p>

<p>The Prince had never before spoken his inmost
thoughts. The Prince of Iran and his mother, though
much disturbed, remained silent. Athura said reprovingly:
“Brother, is it right to have such thoughts before
our father’s body is entombed? Wisdom demands
silence on your part until you see the King! As King
he may act justly. If you stir up trouble, civil war may
be the result. Let us be wise and discreet until we
return to Bactra, from which you ought never to have
departed! Then, if he act unjustly, the people of Iran
will stand justly with you.”</p>

<p>“What say you, my brother?” demanded Bardya,
turning to the Prince.</p>

<p>The latter answered at once and without hesitation:
“The words of your sister are wise. Cambyses is King
of Kings by right of birth and by the will of Cyrus. I
am bound by an oath to support him in that right. It
is not wise to plan against the will of Cyrus, nor is it
even wise to discuss the matter. While we are safe
here, an unwise word uttered at another place, and overheard,
may cause great trouble. As for me, I shall ask
of Cambyses, the King, two favors,—first that I may
receive the reward that Cyrus, the Great King, promised;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
second, that I may accompany you to Bactra after my
father returns here.”</p>

<p>Athura smiled and blushed, as the Prince mentioned
his promised reward and turned his ardent gaze upon her.
Bardya arose and paced back and forth.</p>

<p>“Alas! that my father should bind you and the powerful
King, your father, with an oath!” he cried. “My
way would otherwise be clear! Yes! let us be wise and
patient! You shall come with me to Bactra, and together
we shall extend the empire even as far as the
great river of India and beyond the roof of the world
where the slant-eyed Tourans dwell! King Hystaspis
shall rule Iran in peace, while you and I lead victorious
armies to the ends of the earth! Then we shall see
who ought to be overlord of the world!”</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran now sought to change the subject
by suggesting that before leaving for Bactra they must
hunt a lion in the jungles of Lake Baktigan. Plans for
a hunting-trip to that wild region superseded more
treasonable subjects. After a while, the guests admitted
weariness and retired to rest. But the Prince of Iran
threw a cloak about his shoulders and went out to walk
in the park now flooded with moonlight. The watchmen
respectfully saluted as he passed down the broad steps
and went slowly towards the river. How pleasant it
seemed after a year of war in desert lands to be at home!
He could not retire to rest without standing awhile on
the bridge over the Pulwar and looking down at the
familiar hurrying waters.</p>

<p>Before he reached the bridge, he was startled by the
sound of pursuing footsteps. Turning, he beheld Athura
approaching, followed by one of the guards.</p>

<p>“Pardon, Lord Hystaspis!” she exclaimed, as he went
back to meet her in wondering haste. “So glorious is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the moonlight and so restless am I, that when I saw you
come forth, I could not resist an impulse to follow! Let
me walk with you.”</p>

<p>“Most happy am I to have you with me, Athura, star
of the evening! The light of your eyes surpasses the
light of the stars! Your countenance, like the sun,
brings warmth to my soul! Glad will that day be, when
you shall become my wife; and we shall walk together
thereafter forever!”</p>

<p>He dismissed the guard. Then with his strong right
arm around the princess and his ample cloak shielding
both, they went on together. She laughed happily.</p>

<p>“Indeed, my lord, you have the tongue of a poet!”
she said. “What says the great Zoroaster of this
land?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Ahura-Mazda looked upon the desert lands</div>
<div class="verse">And with his mighty breath gave life to them;</div>
<div class="verse">Where none could dwell before he poured out life,</div>
<div class="verse">And Aryans lived and multiplied in peace,</div>
<div class="verse">Until their numbers were as desert sands.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Was not his thought inspired by such nights as this?”</p>

<p>“It may have been,” he answered. “But does he not
continue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Then Angro-mainyus, death’s dark spirit made</div>
<div class="verse">That mighty serpent, Winter, with its snow,</div>
<div class="verse">To swallow up within its months of cold</div>
<div class="verse">The teeming earth, the flowing water-streams,</div>
<div class="verse">While storm-clouds cast upon the earth their pestilent shade.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“You are melancholy, Prince of Iran! Let us not
think of Angro-mainyus. Are the days not passing
swiftly? When the forty days of mourning shall have
passed, shall we not be happy?”</p>

<p>He drew her closely to him. “Most happy, beloved!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
But I am filled with forebodings of evil. Like some
threatening Angro-mainyus, jealously watching the Spirit
of Life at his creation and the children of men in their
happiness, does the form of the new King of Kings loom
up in the sky. I seem to feel even now the malignant
hate with which he ever seemed to regard Bardya, and
me because I was Bardya’s friend. When I think of the
absolute power of life and death vested in him and his
opportunity to wreak vengeance upon those he hates, I
am troubled. What if he refuse to give you to me?
What if he choose to bestow you upon another?”</p>

<p>He felt the small hand now resting in his clench and
harden. She looked up into his face as she answered
slowly and solemnly:</p>

<p>“As for me, though he inflict death, yet shall he not
bend my will! I have chosen you alone of all the world.
Your wife I shall be or I shall die. Listen, Prince of
Iran! I am moved to say—some spirit prompts my
soul to salute you, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
At your side shall I be Queen of the world! Is it not
to be so?”</p>

<p>He drew her closer to him and kissed her forehead.
“Hush, life of mine!” he replied. “Start no such
thoughts in my soul! Am I not oath-bound? If I were
not so, should I plunge Iran into bloody civil war that I
may wear a crown? Let Ahura-Mazda’s will be done!
If Cambyses and Bardya cease to exist, in spite of my
loyal support, then shall I deem myself most fortunate
to sit on the throne of Cyrus at the side of his daughter.
Ah, if only Cambyses had a soul like Athura, what a
happy year would this be for the nations!”</p>

<p>Twenty-five centuries have come and gone since they
stood on the old stone bridge over the Pulwar and renewed
their pledges of undying love and faith. Myriads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
since then have gazed into each other’s eyes and pledged
the same faith, moved by the same love; but the story is
ever fresh and the love is ever sacred, sweet, and entrancing.
Only traces of the old stone bridge over the
Pulwar remain. The tall, slender shafts of marble with
which the neighboring palace was adorned are tumbled
and broken; and over the ruins of the neighboring city
the wild dog wanders and bays at the moon. Perhaps
the spirits of those heroic two who stood on the old
bridge, listening to the murmur of the waters below,
while they murmured to each other, may return there
again and again, to live once more in the ecstasy of love.
Who knows?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>“I AM CYRUS, THE KING, THE ACHÆMENIAN!”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHERE the Pulwar turns westward from its southerly
course to break through the mountains on its
way to the Araxes, the little mountain stream Mur
joins it from the east. In a vale, at the junction of the
rivers and extending far up along the Mur, was the
city of Anshan, better known as Pasargadæ, “the Castle
of the Persians.” In the midst of the city, Cyrus
had erected a great palace of marble, surrounded by a
magnificent colonnade, and, near this, a tomb. The base
of the tomb was pyramidal and on its truncated top was
a small marble building, much like a Grecian temple,
which was to receive the royal coffin. On the lintel of
the palace-gate and above the door of the tomb was engraved
the legend, “I am Cyrus, the King, the Achæmenian!”
No other record of his acts did he make.
That was all, as if no other Cyrus ever had lived or
could live, who would take from him the attention of
men.</p>

<p>Another great palace stood on an artificial platform
of massive stones at the north side of the valley and a
quarter-mile or so from the tomb. This building was
ancient even at the time of which we write. It had
been for centuries the dwelling of that branch of the
Achæmenian family of which Cyrus was the greatest.
Below and west of the palaces, at the junction of the
streams, were the barracks of the Imperial Guards and
their parade-ground. Above and on the south side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the valley lay the city with its narrow streets, its great
market-place, its stores and dwellings. Many roads
radiated from the city to all parts of the province, some
following the beds of the streams and others crossing
over ridges and spurs of the mountains, or excavated in
the sides of the hills and by bridges passing over deep
chasms.</p>

<p>Cambyses, with one of his wives and his servants, upon
their arrival at Anshan, took possession of the new palace
of Cyrus and remained in seclusion. He gave little
thought to the preparations for the funeral, leaving the
management to Prexaspes, now his Lord High Chamberlain,
and to the nobles and priests in charge of public
services and worship. It was perhaps well for him that
he did, since Prexaspes was gracious and tactful. He
explained to all who were disposed to complain because
Cambyses was inaccessible, that his royal master chose
to remain in seclusion on account of his great grief. He
flattered one and asked advice of another. He impressed
the burly nobles of Persia so well that when the day for
the funeral arrived, they were inclined to think well of
Cambyses.</p>

<p>The time approached when the body of Cyrus should
be placed in its tomb. All roads leading to the capital
city had been for a week enlivened by people coming
from all parts of Iran and even from many foreign
provinces, to witness the solemn ceremony and incidentally
to gaze upon the new King. On horseback, in
carts drawn by oxen or donkeys, on camels or in litters
borne on the shoulders of slaves, the nobles and the
wealthier came; while the lowly plodded along on foot
carrying their food on their backs. The city became a
vast camp, and the hills surrounding it were dotted with
tents and booths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Great multitudes of people massed themselves along
the road leading down to the Pulwar, on the morning of
that day, to await the coming of the funeral cortège approaching
from Persepolis. It was noon before the
Prince of Iran with a company of the Imperial Guard
and the funeral car appeared on the bridge which spanned
the Pulwar, and, followed by a vast train, slowly defiled
across to the parade-ground. The great car, drawn by
eight white horses and followed by chariots in which
rode Prince Bardya and his sisters, moved slowly to the
center of the parade-ground and there halted. The remainder
of the Imperial Guard then crossed and formed
in open square around the car. The people massed themselves
on every side, leaving only a narrow road open to
the city, through which the King would come to greet
his sire’s body.</p>

<p>An officer was despatched to the palace to notify the
King. A sentinel in the gaudy uniform of a palace-guard
met and conducted the messenger into the outer hall of
the palace, where he was received by Prexaspes.</p>

<p>“I bear a message from the Prince of Iran to the King
of Kings,” he said, bowing low before the Lord High
Chamberlain.</p>

<p>“I am Prexaspes, the Lord High Chamberlain,” responded
Prexaspes. “Give me the message. I will bear
it to him. He is at dinner.”</p>

<p>“I am directed by the royal Prince of Iran to report
that the Imperial Guard has arrived with the body of the
Great King, Cyrus, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
We are ready to deliver our charge over to the King’s
hands. We await his orders.”</p>

<p>“It is well. Remain here. I will go in to the King.”</p>

<p>Prexaspes disappeared through a door, the heavy
curtains over which at a motion of his hand were drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
aside by a page. He proceeded slowly and solemnly to
the door of the banquet-room, where a guard in armor
stood aside while he knocked. A harsh voice commanded
him to enter. He opened the door and went in,
falling gracefully on one knee as he saw the King. The
latter was reclining at a table, with only his Assyrian wife
for company. The woman hastily drew a veil over her
face as Prexaspes appeared.</p>

<p>“What now?” demanded the King, frowning. “Am
I not to eat in peace? Presume not too far, Lord
Prexaspes! Speak!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes rose and, clasping his hands before him in
humble attitude, with his eyes directed to the floor lest
they might look upon the Queen, answered, “Let not my
gracious Lord be offended! A messenger has come from
the Prince of Iran announcing his arrival with your
lamented father’s body at the parade-ground by the Pulwar.
I recall that you directed he should await you
there, in order that you might ride forth and do honor
to the great dead and thus gain favor with the people
who loved him.”</p>

<p>“Please the people! Bah! Pigs and dogs are they!”
snorted the King. “Nevertheless your words contain
wisdom. I will follow your advice until such time as
there can be no choice of kings in this realm. Have my
horse ready. Call out my new Imperial Guard. One
can never say what that Bardya may attempt or what
assassins lurk about. Send my armor to the dressing-room.
Begone!”</p>

<p>The King turned away and raised to his lips a huge
cup, wherein sparkled the royal wine of Helbon. Prexaspes
backed out of the room. He told the messenger
to return to the Prince of Iran and command him to
await the coming of the King. Arraying himself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
brilliant armor, he mounted a horse and marshaled the
guards, the nobles, the captive potentates who ate at the
Great King’s table, and all the notables of the city, in
due order.</p>

<p>The King, clad in flexible golden mail and wearing a
plain black cap on his head, after some delay came forth
and mounted his horse. The illustrious company then
moved solemnly down towards the parade-ground. A
score of uniformed officers rode in front with spears
held perpendicularly, the hafts resting on their stirrups.
After them rode the King, followed by Prexaspes and a
company of guards. The nobles and notables followed.
The King’s expression was gloomy and abstracted. He
looked over the heads of the people, and his glance was
high and haughty.</p>

<p>Moved by habit, the people bowed low as he went by
and remained thus until he had quite passed. There was
no sound. Had Cyrus been passing, roars of worshipful
shouts would have greeted him from all sides. Cambyses
knew this and in his heart raged because of the silence.
His square, heavy body, his bull neck, and his round,
bloated face suggested to the people no majesty. A
murmur ran through the masses in which were mingled
fear and derision.</p>

<p>At one point the crowd pressed too heavily and forced
back the guards drawn up at the sides of the way.
Cambyses, whose horse shied somewhat at the commotion
as the guards endeavored to drive the crowd back, shouted
angrily: “Beat the dogs back! Use the points of your
spears!” The guards, thus urged, smote lustily with the
hafts of their spears, bringing cries of agony and imprecations
from the hapless ones who received their
blows. The crowd surged back and the King passed on
without further comment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Meanwhile Bardya and his sisters and the Prince of
Iran patiently waited the coming of the King. The
Prince occupied himself in passing slowly along the
massed ranks of the Guard, greeting his veteran comrades
with a word of praise or inquiry and granting them leave
to return home for a twenty days’ furlough. A guard
of twenty officers stood around the funeral car and
grooms stood at the heads of the white horses hitched
to it. Two other grooms held by the bits the war-horse
on which Cyrus had been mounted when stricken by the
fatal dart. The noble animal pricked up his sharp ears
and looked about with interested, intelligent eyes, not
understanding that he was about to be sacrificed to
Ahura-Mazda in honor of his master.</p>

<p>Bardya and several Persians of high degree, among
whom were three of the seven lords of Persia, Gobryas,
Metaphernes, and Aspathines, were standing in a group
near the car. Upon them the Prince of Iran cast many
uneasy glances. He feared plots and treason. Some
paces from them were two litters with drawn curtains,
wherein rested the Princesses Athura and Artistone.</p>

<p>A subdued murmur rose from the multitudes as they
waited. The veteran troopers commented on all things
and all men, some of their remarks being decidedly
treasonable.</p>

<p>“By rights,” growled one, whose whiskers covered the
larger part of his face and chest, “our Prince here ought
to be King of Kings! May Ahriman fly away with
oaths! Now this Cambyses is no soldier. As for
Bardya, he compares not with our Prince.”</p>

<p>“Right!” admitted his neighbor. “Cyrus lives in the
Prince of Iran. The King is a drunken savage. Prince
Bardya is a gentle giant of no great wit. It is said the
Princess Athura is most like her father. She and our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Prince will marry. Cyrus promised it. God send the
day when our Prince shall wear the double crown and
she shall stand at his side as Queen!”</p>

<p>“Treason, brother!” chided a third. “Hush! Let
your jaws cease to wag of royalty.”</p>

<p>Finally the King appeared. He drew near to the
funeral car alone. His gloomy, black eyes rested coldly
for a moment upon his brother, to whom he bent his
head slightly. Bardya returned his salutation with a low,
somewhat ironical bow. At that instant the Prince of
Iran, who had drawn near, raised his hand as a signal,
and instantly a crash of spear-hafts dashed against bucklers,
a roar of voices from the Guard and fanfare of
trumpets, sounded in royal salute. The old Imperial
Guard thus recognized the new King of Kings. Cambyses,
at first startled, flushed with pleasure and acknowledged
the salute with bow and wave of hand. The
great lords of Persia now advanced, one to hold his
horse, another to hold his stirrup, and a third to receive
the imperial scepter from his hand as he dismounted.</p>

<p>Having safely dismounted, Cambyses turned to his
brother and said, “Well, Prince, we meet under altered
circumstances! If I recollect rightly, our last meeting
was somewhat unpleasant, resulting in guard-house treatment
for me on account of you. But on this day we
forget old animosities and bury our sire’s body. Afterwards
I shall have somewhat to say to you.”</p>

<p>“I have forgotten the incident referred to,” answered
Bardya, coldly. “We are here now to honor the dead.
Afterwards I shall be pleased to converse with you about
the welfare of our empire.”</p>

<p>Cambyses said no more. Uncovering his head, he approached
the funeral car and bowed his head towards it,
remaining thus a moment as if in prayer. Silence fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
upon the people as they watched the King. Then the
sound of weeping began. A wave of grief and sympathy
swept over the assembled multitude. The King was
mourning. The people mourned also.</p>

<p>Having thus greeted the spirit of his sire, Cambyses
turned away and went to the litters where his sisters
reclined. They came forth and bowed to him in greeting.
He kissed their foreheads, saying: “It is a great
pleasure to have you near me. You shall have the old
palace for your residence,—you and Prince Bardya,—while
you remain here. At a more fitting time we shall
renew our acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Then he remounted his horse and ordered the final
march to begin. Prexaspes with the King’s body-guard
led the way back to the city. The funeral car followed.
The King rode behind it and, following him, were
Prince Bardya, the Prince of Iran, the Princesses, and
the great nobles. The lesser notables and the Imperial
Guard marched next, followed by the people. Thus with
royal pomp, amidst the mourning of his people, Cyrus,
the Great King, the Achæmenian, completed his worldly
march. A band of white-robed priests slaughtered the
noble war-horse and presented his blood and burned
portions of his flesh as a sacrifice to Ahura-Mazda, with
many prayers. The solemn chants being ended, the
golden casket in which the body of the great dead was
encased was carried up the steps of the pyramid and
deposited in the temple-like vault on its top. The brazen
door of the tomb was closed, bolted, and sealed and a
guard set over it. The people then dispersed.</p>

<p>The King made a decree by which a special order of
military rank was instituted, whose sole duty it was
to watch the tomb, that no man should disturb the sacred
body of the hero.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>So was laid to rest the body of the most knightly
king and heroic figure of ancient Iran. The great Darius
probably equaled him in generalship and excelled him
in statesmanship; but the brilliant career, the gentle and
knightly qualities, and the heroic spirit of Cyrus, are
without parallel in ancient story. Not until the great
Alexander flashed across the western sky did any meteor
excel in brightness him whose simple epitaph was, “I am
Cyrus, the King, the Achæmenian!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>A ROYAL COUNCIL AND A ROYAL HUNT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the day after the funeral of Cyrus. Cambyses,
the Great King, was in a black humor. The fatigue
incident to the funeral services and the reaction from
intoxication caused by too much drink, indulged in afterward,
had darkened his vision and sharpened his
acerbity. When he awoke and sat up on his silk-covered
couch, he felt the need of immediate refreshment. He
jerked a cord hanging conveniently at hand, and a bell
jangled in an adjoining hall. Instantly two servants
appeared, slipping in between the heavy folds of a curtain
at the doorway, and prostrated themselves before
him.</p>

<p>“Rise up, dogs! Bring me soma!” he roared.</p>

<p>Swiftly and noiselessly as fleeting shadows they arose
and disappeared. In a moment the King’s cup-bearer
appeared with a golden goblet in hand, followed by the
servants bearing a vessel of milky, fiery liquid. The
cup-bearer bowed low, the servants set down the jar and
were about to prostrate themselves again, when Cambyses
cried impatiently, “Omit salutations and pour!”</p>

<p>The potent fluid sparkled as it flowed into the goblet
from the vessel. Twice was the goblet filled and twice
did he drain it. “Begone!” he then commanded.
“Send the bath hither!”</p>

<p>Cup-bearer and servants withdrew, walking backward.
A moment later the servants came in again, bearing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
large tub of water. With their assistance the King proceeded
to bathe. Unfortunately for one, he dropped a
towel and received a buffet from the King’s fist that
caused him to reel.</p>

<p>“Have care!” roared Cambyses. “To the guard-house
you go to-day and thence to the kitchen as scullion!”</p>

<p>The man prostrated himself and prayed for pardon.
Royalty made no sign and he withdrew. Another came
to take his place. After the bath, the King’s hair was
combed, curled, and perfumed. The royal barber
trimmed his whiskers deftly and carefully waxed them.
Then he was arrayed in fine linen and purple. His
breakfast was brought into the room, and he sat down
to eat. He then sent a page to summon Prexaspes. The
latter, elegantly dressed and well groomed as usual, soon
appeared and, bending till his hands touched the floor,
saluted.</p>

<p>“May the King live forever!”</p>

<p>In obedience to a wave of the King’s hand, the servants
disappeared.</p>

<p>“See that none stand near the door! Let the guard
move away to the outer room!” commanded the King.</p>

<p>Prexaspes saw that the orders were obeyed. Then,
resuming his deferential attitude before his royal master,
with bowed head, eyes to the floor, and hands crossed
before him, he awaited the royal pleasure. The King,
having eaten in silence some minutes, pushed away the
remainder of the food.</p>

<p>“Prexaspes,” he said truculently, “I know you! I
know you are faithful to me because you hope to win
power and not because you love me. So be it! Royal
place you cannot have owing to the accident of birth, but
royal power you may win if you will. Are you ready
to carry out all my wishes or must I seek another?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>He paused. Prexaspes raised his eyes and noted his
master’s expression.</p>

<p>“Royal master,” he said quietly, “you read men with
the eye of God! It is true I love power and riches and I
know that both may be given me by you and none other.
I am your slave to command.”</p>

<p>“Well said! I, who am descended from Jemshid
and Kaiomurs, from Achæmenius and Cyrus, am able
to make you great. Just as there may be one God in
heaven, so I am the one God on earth. There is but one
family fitted to rule the earth and that is mine. Is it not
so?”</p>

<p>“It is so.”</p>

<p>“Since it is so, is not the will of the Great King of the
Persians and Medes and of the whole world above the
laws of this empire?”</p>

<p>“The King’s word is law.”</p>

<p>“If, then, the Great King command you to do an act,
that act, even if it be the taking of life contrary to Persian
law, becomes lawful. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>For an instant Prexaspes clasped his fingers together
nervously.</p>

<p>“It might be lawful, O King,” he answered slowly.
“But though your power is great, there are in this land
of Persia great nobles who claim great rights and
powers, and who would maintain that Persian law must
not be broken even by the Great King. I know the
great wisdom and the courage of the King; but if I may
be permitted to speak, I would give the advice of one
who has studied these matters deeply.”</p>

<p>“I know!” exclaimed the King, impatiently. “I saw
the dour faces of the nobles and the hostility of the people.
My father unreasonably inflicted punishments upon
me and my friends, and knowledge thereof has soured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the minds of all toward me. That cursed Bardya, who
supplanted me in my father’s love, yet lives! I would
sooner trust Darius Hystaspis than those nobles; and he
loves me not!”</p>

<p>“It is true the Prince of Iran loves you not. But he
is loyal. My only fear is that if Bardya should—should
be slain by your order, the nobles would attack even you,
and by their vast power among the Persian people they
might overthrow you and place the King of Iran on the
throne.”</p>

<p>The King arose from the table and paced back and
forth, grinding his teeth in wrath. He realized the
truth of Prexaspes’ words.</p>

<p>“There can be but one King on earth!” he exclaimed.
“That King must be Cambyses. Bardya must die! As
for Darius Hystaspis, I would order him to death, did I
not believe his father would head a revolt in Iran such
as I care not to meet. But I hate him! What then do
you advise?”</p>

<p>“As to Bardya, I advise that he be put away secretly,
if he must die. Let it be reported that he has returned
to Bactra or that the King has given him a secluded residence
in Medea, where he chose to retire for meditation.
A stout person might—”</p>

<p>“No!” roared the King. “I have said he shall die!
But let it be secretly done. Do it yourself and I will
make you chief counselor of state forever, second only
to myself!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes drew in his breath sharply.</p>

<p>“The King hath spoken!” he answered slowly. “I
myself will slay the young man. Let the King’s word
stand and not be withdrawn.”</p>

<p>“It shall stand!” the King assured him, taking a seal
ring from his finger. “Take this in token of the King’s
word.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Prexaspes bowed low and took the glittering band.</p>

<p>“Now as to this Prince of Iran and his seditious
Guard, what of them?” demanded the King.</p>

<p>Prexaspes hesitated a moment before he answered.
“The Prince may be dealt with in two ways. Possibly
the King may not have heard that he has dared to raise
his eyes to Athura, the King’s most beautiful sister; and
it is reported that she regards him with great favor.
And your father promised her to him. Now it might be
that if she be given him in marriage at once, it would
bind him more firmly to support your rule, and—”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried the King, smiting his hands together.
“Let them marry? Why, that would indeed be showing
him favor! That would be placing him on the
throne! For I have no children; and if Bardya die, who
remains? Athura would be queen, and he would be
King. Never! I hate him as bitterly as I do Bardya.
I hate Athura, the haughty favorite of my father, ever
preaching good deeds and well-doing to me!”</p>

<p>“Then I advise that he be given a command in a distant
province. It is rumored that the Lydians are restless
and that the tribes on the northern borders thereof
are making forays. Send him and the old Guard
thither. Mayhap a dart shall find him. At least he will
be far from these Persians. His oath will keep him
faithful. Let a decree be made praising him for faithful
service and elevating him to the honor of a satrapy where
war will keep him busy.”</p>

<p>The King laughed, a cruel, mirthless laugh, as he
assented. “The advice is good! So be it. Bardya
shall disappear to meditate—beyond the stars! Darius
and Athura shall love each other, verily, but separated
by two hundred parasangs! See to it! Prepare
proper decrees. And Prexaspes—it is in my mind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
occupy these warlike peoples in a war of conquest, even
as did my father. We will prove that we too know how
to conquer! There is Egypt still independent and very
rich and powerful. We must have tribute to live in
state as becomes the ruler of the world. Amasis claims
to be equal to Cambyses—he shall bite the dust!
After him, the Hellenes shall feel my power beyond the
sea. Go, Prexaspes! It shall be yours to estimate the
necessary revenues and to prepare the means to feed an
army of five hundred thousand men who will march with
me to Egypt. But, first, see to it that no brother remains
behind to rouse up rebellion!”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you order. The King is very wise.
War with Egypt will occupy the minds of the Persian
nobles and will enable us to levy taxes on all the nations
for the King’s treasury.”</p>

<p>“Be not in too great haste with this war,” continued
Cambyses. “There is much to do; and life is very enjoyable
in fall at Susa, in winter at Babylon, and in
spring at Hamadan.”</p>

<p>Prexaspes bowed low and withdrew.</p>

<p>Later that day, the King sat in state on the throne in
the great central hall of the palace and received the
nobles of Persia and Medea and the officers of his court.
Prexaspes stood at his right hand. Embassies from distant
realms, visitors from foreign lands, and deputations
from divers cities came to wait upon the Great
King before returning to their various places. All petitioners,
in accordance with the new etiquette, prostrated
themselves before the King and so remained until bidden
to arise. But the nobles of Iran, though they bowed
low before him with hands on their breasts, did not bend
the knee or prostrate themselves. The King greeted
them coldly, resolving within himself that he would some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
day humble them till they also should prostrate themselves
at his feet and feel his foot on their necks.</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran, tall, stately, richly but plainly
appareled, came also. He was cordial in his greeting of
the King, as became a blood-relative, but beneath the
folds of his Medean cloak a light chain armor guarded
his body from dagger-thrusts, even as his cordial manner
concealed the distrust he felt towards Cambyses.
To him Prexaspes made low obeisance. The nobles of
Persia also bowed low before him with profound respect.
The King became very gracious and smiled upon
him as he approached. He arose from his throne and
gave the Prince his royal hand.</p>

<p>“Cousin Darius,” he said, “it pleases me very greatly
to have you here! I have disturbing news from the
satrapy of our old friend Crœsus. It is said that discontent
and revolt arise there and that bands of Scythians
trouble its northern borders. I have been considering
deeply what reward would be sufficient for one who
brought the body of the Great King, my father, to its
tomb. I have determined to appoint you satrap of all
our empire beyond the Euphrates. In order that you
may be well supported, I have prepared a decree that
you may take with you the old Imperial Guard of my
father to become the nucleus of the army which shall,
under your command, uphold our empire there. I contemplate
no less a conquest than that of Egypt at some
convenient time; and it shall be your duty to levy additional
soldiers among the people of your provinces for
that war. When I march by Damascus and Tyre, you
shall join me there with a well-disciplined army and you
shall have chief command under me.”</p>

<p>The Prince listened in amazement. Except Babylon,
the western provinces were the richest and most important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
of the conquered provinces in the empire.
Knowing the King’s ancient hatred towards him, he was
at a loss to understand why this great honor was given
him. From the keen, beadlike stare of the King’s dark
eyes he turned inquiringly to Prexaspes, who averted
his face. He was silent a moment, seeking to penetrate
the King’s design. It must be that, as King, Cambyses
was not following the footsteps of Cambyses, the
Prince.</p>

<p>“The Great King’s commands will be obeyed,” he answered
presently. “I thank you for the honor so little
deserved. But I had somewhat in my heart to ask the
King, should I be permitted to speak.”</p>

<p>“Say on!” said the King, the expression of his face
denoting apprehension.</p>

<p>“When your sire, the ever victorious Cyrus, was about
to die, he gave me his consent and promise that I should
marry the Princess Athura if she were willing. This
was a special mark of his favor. I now ask of you,
Great King, that which he promised and which you, as
the head of your father’s family, may grant—the hand
of the King’s sister in marriage.”</p>

<p>Cambyses was astonished at the boldness of the
Prince. His face instantly flushed with wrath. He was
about to exclaim violently, when he observed the gaze
of Prexaspes turned upon him warningly and remembered
that it was his part to dissemble. He resumed
his seat on the throne. Constraining his anger, he said,
speaking rapidly and in some confusion:</p>

<p>“This is a matter to which thought must be given.
The time is not right. The matters demanding attention
in your satrapy are urgent. I wish you to make ready
and depart within ten days. I must have a Prince of
the Empire in that part of my dominions. Your subjects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
are a warlike people who need a firm hand. As to
my sister, I will talk with her. It would not be meet
that the marriage take place before you go or until the
days of mourning for her father elapse. The urgency
of the case will not admit at this time of any delay, lest
those Lydians and Scythians rise in open rebellion. I
see no obstacle in the way of such marriage; but later
I will consider it. Some months’ active campaigning
may be your lot when no thoughts could be given to marriage.
Prepare to march without delay and to put down
the King’s enemies with a strong hand. If the hand of
my sister in marriage be a prize to be sought after by
you, faithful service to my interests may be thus rewarded.
Here is my decree appointing you to your
office. Rest assured that if my sister wills to be your
wife, she shall be given by me to no other man.”</p>

<p>Prexaspes drew from his belt a roll of papyrus and
presented it to the King, who handed it to the Prince.
The latter took it, bowed low, and, turning on his heel,
departed without further word. After he had disappeared
the King turned to Prexaspes.</p>

<p>“What think you?” he asked. “Does it please him?
And what will he do?”</p>

<p>“It pleases him not, but he will obey.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran passed out of the King’s presence
deeply troubled. Was the King seeking to honor him
and beginning to reign in a truly kinglike manner? Or
was he seeking to be rid of him and his favorite troops?
Mounting a horse at the gate of the palace park, where
his faithful groom, Orobates, awaited him, he rode
directly to the old palace where Bardya and his sisters
were residing. There he dismounted and was quickly
ushered into the presence of Princess Athura. He
found her sitting upon a divan in the inner court, playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
on a harp and softly singing to its accompaniment.
Several young women companions had left the room
when the servants announced the coming of the Prince.</p>

<p>“Greeting and welcome!” she said smilingly, as the
young man bowed low before her. She put aside the
harp and arose. “Be seated, illustrious Prince, at my
right hand!” He kissed the hands extended to him,
and both sat down on the divan.</p>

<p>At once noting the serious expression of his countenance,
the Princess asked, “What so serious as to cause
frowns and wrinkles?”</p>

<p>“I have stood before the King as I said I would and
asked that he consent to our marriage,” he answered.
“Instead of consenting, he does me the honor to appoint
me governor of Lydia and command me to depart forthwith,
saying there is urgent need and that I must take
with me the Guard.”</p>

<p>“What? Another war? And must you go?”</p>

<p>“It is the King’s command! It is not an honor that
he is giving me. It is his desire to place me among those
who know me not! Foolish King! He will find none
less likely to rebel than I. It is not in his mind to consent
to our marriage. He made no promise. He said
he would think of it and speak with you.”</p>

<p>“But he shall consent!” exclaimed Athura, warmly.
“If not, then will I go with you and marry you without
his consent. He shall never control me or send me
where I do not choose to go!”</p>

<p>“My soul rejoices to hear you say this!” said the
Prince, drawing her close to him with encircling arm.
“But we must have patience. He is King. He is the
head of your family. Should we marry without his consent,
he might deem it such insult to his majesty as to
lead him to immediate violence. I fear that I may some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
day be compelled to forget my sacred oath to his father.
Let us exercise patience, light of mine eyes, hope of my
soul!”</p>

<p>Her regal head rested on his strong shoulder. She
touched lightly with her fingers the dark locks of hair
that graced his brow. Presently, as she remained silent,
he continued:</p>

<p>“He may consent that you come to me. What happiness
would be mine! But you—it would mean a
foreign land, and possibly dwelling in the midst of
war.”</p>

<p>“Am I not my father’s daughter? Am I afraid of
war? It would be joy to go with you, to see new lands,
new peoples, to be a queen where you would be virtually
king, to ride a horse in battle! I will wait for you
to come or to send for me. No other man, be he King
or noble, shall I ever marry. If not you, none other!”</p>

<p>“Nor shall I have any other queen than you, beloved
of my soul! Let us not despair. I will speak to the
Persian nobles if he does not presently consent. Their
influence and my father’s may force his consent. If danger
threaten you, fly to my mother. She will protect you
even against Cambyses.”</p>

<p>Further converse was interrupted by the sound of footsteps
approaching from the outer hallway and the immediate
appearance of Prince Bardya at the door. He
had evidently just come from a ride, as his clothes and
whip indicated. His handsome, flushed countenance indicated
rapid riding through the wind. He smiled, as his
sister and the Prince arose in embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>“Pardon my intrusion, beloved sister and brother!”
he begged. “I have had a wonderful gallop over the
hills towards Lake Baktigan, and some rough climbing.
Have you seen the other King this day?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The Prince of Iran briefly related his visit to the King
and its result. Bardya nervously slapped the riding whip
against his boots and a frown gathered on his brow as he
listened.</p>

<p>“His object is plain!” he exclaimed, as the Prince
ceased speaking. “He sends you to a distant place that
you may not be near me, a very shrewd trick! He will
never allow you to marry Athura because he hates you
both. But let us defy him! My sister shall go with me.
Then you may come, Prince, and marry her! We shall
defy him. We shall acknowledge him as overlord, according
to my father’s will; but not a foot shall he set
on our lands—neither he nor any servants of his!”</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran was disturbed at Bardya’s words.
It was evident that the latter intended to declare his independence
as soon as possible and that war would ensue.
What would be his own duty then? His oath would align
him with Cambyses; his heart would drive him to Bardya.</p>

<p>“Great Prince,” he answered, “I know you love me as
a friend and so I make bold to speak a warning. Do not
utter such thoughts aloud any more. Ears may hear and
tongues may carry to the King’s ears. Then he would
surely have you arrested and slain. I counsel prudence
and extreme watchfulness. Return as soon as possible
to Bactra. I long to go with you. But I must obey his
decree or be placed in the position of rebelling. I go as
ordered. After the war is finished (if I find it necessary
to make war), I will demand Athura. If he refuse consent,
I will leave his service and enter yours, but never as
against him. But I do not think he will dare deny my
suit. Am I not an Achæmenian, and is there any of
higher birth?”</p>

<p>“I will heed your advice,” replied Bardya. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
were ever wise and far-seeing. I will be silent and
watchful. The guards you gave me ride with me always.
One sleeps at my bedroom door, and the others guard
the palace doors and grounds. But if you march hence
in ten days, it behooves me to seek others.”</p>

<p>“I will furnish them from the faithful retainers on
my father’s estate. But I advise immediate return to
Bactra, even if it must be by flight in the night. I am
greatly troubled for your safety.”</p>

<p>Bardya laughed. “You are needlessly alarmed,” he
asserted. “But on the morrow I will announce to the
King my purpose of returning forthwith.”</p>

<p>At this moment there came a knock at the door and a
servant appeared. “A messenger stands at the door,” he
announced.</p>

<p>“Admit him!” commanded Bardya.</p>

<p>A man in the King’s livery entered, and bowing almost
to the floor before royalty, presented a folded bit of papyrus
to Bardya. The latter took it, unfolded it, and
read. He then ordered the messenger to retire, and after
he had disappeared he read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Cambyses, the King of Kings, King of the World, to
his Brother, Bardya, and to his Sisters, Athura and Artistone,
greeting:</p>

<p>“‘Know that I propose to remain here two weeks
longer and will then return to Hamadan. It is my will
that you make ready to accompany me to that city in
order that my court may be graced by your presence and
that the people may know that we are of good-will towards
you. Later my brother may depart thence to
his provinces. Farewell.</p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Cambyses.</span>’”</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“My brother is beginning to rule us very soon!” exclaimed
Athura, indignantly.</p>

<p>“He shall not order me!” exclaimed Bardya, fiercely.</p>

<p>“He is King!” warned the Prince of Iran. “Hamadan
is many parasangs nearer Bactra than this city. It is
also nearer Lydia. I counsel obedience. It will be
easier to escape from Hamadan than from Pasargadæ,
if escape you must; and a week’s journey will then bring
you into your own realm. Besides, it may be, the King
is earnestly desirous of showing good-will.”</p>

<p>“Good-will!” rejoined Bardya. “The King speaks
of my ‘provinces,’ as if I were a mere satrap! It seems
to me that I should be first consulted in such matters.
It is in my mind to return to him a message that I choose
to remain here for a time and then to return direct to
Bactra.”</p>

<p>Bardya strode back and forth across the room wrathfully.
He threw the King’s message on the floor and
trampled upon it. The Prince of Iran watched him in
gloomy silence. Athura went to her brother and placing
her hand on his shoulders made him halt and look down
into her clear, steady eyes. More than once she had
calmed the anger of her impetuous younger brother
thus.</p>

<p>“Brother, listen to me!” she said imploringly.
“Listen to the Prince of Iran, if not to me! We are
older than you, and you have never found us unfaithful
to your interests. Cambyses is King of Kings, King of
the World, by right of birth and by your father’s last
decree. He speaks fairly to you. It is right that we
visit him at his court in Hamadan and render him the
honor due to him. You are here in his power. You
should never have come hither at all. Wisdom dictates
that you go to Hamadan, in all brotherly kindness. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
should he show an evil disposition, it will be much easier
to escape to Bactra. At all events, brother, be not first
to bring on war. Only in a just cause will the Aryans
follow you.”</p>

<p>Bardya was impressed. He kissed her forehead. “I
will do as you advise,” he replied. “I am crippled by
that oath our father exacted of the King of Iran and of
our Prince here. Without their aid, it would be wild,
foolish, and impossible to begin war. I feel that should
I begin the war, even they would oppose me with the
armies of Iran. I am no better than a caged tiger.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran looked upon his young friend
sorrowfully. “My father and I have sworn!” he said.
“How can our words return to us? We are bound to
support Cambyses as King of Kings. No less are we
bound to aid you if oppressed by him. We will not
fail you. Should he seek to detain you, we shall demand
your release, even at the head of an army. What can
you ask more? That we be oath-breakers?”</p>

<p>“No, I ask it not! I will be guided by your advice.”</p>

<p>Having thus decided, the three composed a message
from Bardya to the King, notifying him that it would
please Bardya to visit Hamadan on his way to Bactra and
be his guest for some days. The Prince of Iran then
took his departure and went to the camp of the Imperial
Guard. After detailing a strong company to guard the
palace wherein slept his beloved, he called a council of
all his chief captains and read to them the King’s decree
directing him and the Guard to march into Western
Asia. The captains were delighted. The common soldiers,
when they heard the news next day, broke forth
in a pandemonium of jubilation. To march into the
rich country of rich old Crœsus with their beloved Prince,
to gain renown and wealth, though by hard knocks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
under such a leader—what more could a stout warrior
ask? So they all rejoiced and one and all agreed that
King Cambyses was a wise King. But their Prince and
Commander was silent and sorrowful.</p>

<p>Cambyses announced, two days later, that it pleased
him to accept the invitation of the Prince of Iran to
hunt royal game on his estates in the jungles surrounding
Lake Baktigan. This lake is a brackish body of
water lying in the bottom of a long, narrow valley between
low mountains, a day’s journey south of Persepolis.
It is shallow in summer and fall, but in spring, after the
winter rains, fed by the floods of the Araxes and several
mountain torrents, it rises to respectable dimensions,
and is then about sixty miles long by five wide. Reeds,
grass, shrubs, and stunted trees cover its shores. On
the hills near is some heavy timber. Little known to the
modern traveler, yet, in the ancient days, it was a resort
of royal hunters who dared to seek the lion and the tiger
in their lairs. It was a part of the estates of the King
of Iran. The Prince, as was the custom, had invited
the King of Kings to make free use of all his father’s
property. But he was surprised when Cambyses indicated
that he would hunt. Prexaspes had advised his
royal master to accept because it would please the Persian
nobility. Cambyses also desired to show himself
a mighty hunter, as had all his ancestry, and this influenced
him to dissemble his true feeling towards the
Prince and to accept his invitation. Prince Bardya and
the great lords of Persia were invited to attend. It
fell upon the Prince of Iran as host to provide transportation,
victuals, equipage, and beaters; and right
royally did he provide.</p>

<p>It was an imposing expedition that marched down the
swift Araxes to the jungles of Lake Baktigan. First,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
on a big horse, rode a magnificently attired master of
the hunt, glittering in gold and silver and gorgeous
in crimson uniform. Then followed several hundred
skilled hunters, wardens of the estate whose duty it
was to furnish the table of King Hystaspis with game
and to guard his preserves against common robbers and
poachers. They were arrayed in distinctive uniform
and were mounted on wiry animals used to hill-climbing
and hunting. With them was a pack of hounds. Then
rode King Cambyses, on a beautiful white stallion, and
looking right royal in his close-fitting tunic, his leather
riding-breeches, red shoes, and round felt cap in which
were stuck several black eagle feathers. A stout armor-bearer
rode next with the King’s short sword, a buckler,
a stout bow, and a quiver full of arrows. Another
servant carried javelins and a heavy spear. At the
King’s left and half a horse behind rode Prexaspes
similarly arrayed. Behind them rode the Prince of
Iran, Prince Bardya, and a hundred or more notables.
Many pack-animals and servants followed with the impedimenta.</p>

<p>They camped in a dense forest at the northern end
of the lake, where the Araxes poured in its flood of fresh
water. Next day the hunt began. The chief huntsman
built a low platform in the branches of a live-oak
which stood at the crossing of several jungle paths
about a mile below the camp. The King and his armor-bearers
took station on this, while the nobles and retainers
formed in line at some distance to the rear in
order to turn the game should it pass him. Cambyses
was a great archer. It was his daily custom to practice
shooting with the heavy Persian bow. He boasted that
no man in Iran could excel him. None ever did excel
in his presence, it being convenient to miss and stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
lower in the scores than his Royal Highness. It is
related that the King was accustomed to shoot apples
from the heads or hands of boys, an example possibly
followed by William Tell of later fame. The King
later attempted this feat with the son of Prexaspes and
slew the son.</p>

<p>The huntsmen went to a point several miles down the
lake, and, having formed a long line with one end resting
on the shore and the other far out on the hills, marched
with shouts, horn-blowing, and drum-beating northward
and drove the savage denizens of the wilderness towards
the King. The latter acquitted himself very well. Deer
and antelope fell before his arrows. Jackals, snapping
at the shafts which pierced their vitals, tumbled about and
died. The King roared with savage laughter as the
stricken animals leaped to their death. A wild boar was
smitten, but, gnashing his teeth in rage and pain, he
turned upon the beaters desperately and gashed one
severely with his tusks. Animals which escaped the
King ran the gantlet of weapons in the hands of the
nobles. The slaughter was great. Two lions were
aroused, but they broke through the line of beaters and
escaped. That night all feasted on the King’s meat and
praised his skill.</p>

<p>On the next day Cambyses decided to hunt on foot,
following the hunters with hounds through the jungle
paths. His nobles followed to witness his feats of arms.
Hunters and beaters formed a long semicircular line
with the wings thrust forward, one along the margin of
the lake, and the other along a ridge running parallel
thereto. The King was at the middle of the line with
the chief hunter. The Prince of Iran, Prince Bardya,
and several of the nobles followed closely after him.</p>

<p>Several smaller animals soon fell before the King’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
archery, but he fretted because no lion or tiger appeared.
He ordered the hounds unloosed. They sprang away
into the jungle, and almost immediately terrific roars announced
the presence of lions. A female and a young
lion appeared, dashing towards the hills, the mother
turning now and again to leap at the snarling pack baying
at her heels. The King loosed an arrow at her, but
it fell short. He was about to pursue, when a more
thunderous roar close by warned him of the proximity
of another royal beast. An instant later, a black-maned
male lion appeared in an open space twenty paces distant,
lashing his tail and emitting breathy coughs of rage.
The animal paused but an instant, crouching low, then
leaped towards the King with gigantic bounds. The
King drew an arrow to its head and launched it. It
smote the lion in the shoulder, but missed a vital point.
Cries of terror arose from the attendants, and the armor-bearer
of the King sought to interpose his buckler between
the beast and his master. But master and man
went down in a heap under the impact of the lion’s
heavy body. Then the Persian nobles gallantly hastened
to the rescue. The Prince of Iran dashed forward with
a heavy spear and thrust the sharp blade into the red
mouth of the lion as it sprang to meet him. It reared
up on hind legs, battling with the heavy spear. Prince
Bardya then shot an arrow into the beast’s side with
such force that the barb passed through its body. Its
heart was transfixed; the great beast gasped, fell over,
and died.</p>

<p>Cambyses was not severely injured, but was much
chagrined. He had missed a fair shot, been ignobly
thrown down, and saved by those he hated. He gave
short thanks to his saviors and berated his armor-bearer
for not interposing more effectually. He hunted no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
more after that on foot in the jungle, but he succeeded
in slaying two lions from the safety of a platform
erected in a tree.</p>

<p>The hunt thus having proved a success, the King returned
to Pasargadæ.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>THE DEEPER THINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Prince of Iran, about to depart on the King’s
business, knelt before his mother to receive her
final blessing. The stately dame allowed no tear to dim
her eye and no tremor to weaken her voice during this
ceremony.</p>

<p>“Go, my son, with my love and faith in you,” she
said. “But remember your royal birth. Should your
sire die, you will be head of the royal family in Iran;
and by reason of your descent from an elder brother,
you will be entitled to overlord even Cambyses. Your
father has been content to be second to Cyrus, but I
shall yet behold you crowned King of Kings!”</p>

<p>“Not while Bardya and his brother, the Great King,
live, mother!” replied the Prince, arising from his knee.
“But I shall remember your words.”</p>

<p>She bowed low before him, as to a superior. “Son,
I salute you, King that is to be!” she said, smiling.</p>

<p>Troubled in spirit, he kissed her cheek and turned
away.</p>

<p>The mother watched her son until he disappeared
among the trees of the park. Then, throwing a veil
over her head and face, she went to the seclusion of her
bedchamber, there to weep the bitter tears of grief she
would not let the world see. The Prince hastened to
the stone bridge where Bardya and Athura, who had
preceded him, were waiting to utter their farewells.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Bardya kissed his friend’s cheeks, embraced him tenderly,
then mounted a horse and rode away to the city.
Athura and the Prince lingered on the bridge awhile,
loath to part. The perfume of flowers filled the air,
as the sun kissed away the dewdrops from their petals.
The voices of birds and the ripple of water formed an
orchestra attuned to the songs of love.</p>

<p>“When I am permitted to return to this paradise, I
will build there, by the side of my father’s palace, another
twice as large and adorned with greater splendor,” he
said, as they were about to separate. “There shall you
dwell as becomes the Queen of the Aryans and the
ruler of my soul.”</p>

<p>“May your mother’s prophecy come true, beloved!”
she replied. “I shall count the days till your return,
or until I go to you. Send for me quickly and I will
come. That brother of mine, who calls himself King of
Kings, shall not prevent me. Listen! Should I send to
you, asking aid, will you come, even though in disobedience
to his orders?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Did not Cyrus at the same time he exacted
my oath also promise you to me? But Cambyses will
not dare refuse you or insult me by long refusing his
consent to our marriage.”</p>

<p>“His hatred toward us may overrule his reason.”</p>

<p>“Then he shall listen to force! I will send a letter
to him as soon as my government is placed in order, demanding
that he send you to me. He will then have no
excuse.”</p>

<p>“Send quickly then, for I fear trouble!” Tears filled
her dark eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Should he trouble you, go to my father!” he said
reassuringly. “He will call in the seven great nobles
of Persia to your aid. Even Cambyses will fear them.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>What else was said need not be recorded. Love, in
these great ones of earth, produced the same sighs, the
same halting words, the repetition of promises, assurances,
and pledges, the same beaming eyes and fluttering
hearts, as it ever has in all who have loved, be they
high or low, known or unknown, sung or unsung. They
parted, he to join the waiting Imperial Guard, now to
be known as the Prince of Iran’s Guard, and she to
return to his mother.</p>

<p>Having marched rapidly to Susa, the Prince and his
army encamped in a plain near that city. The satrap
of Susa was ordered to procure supplies and a caravan
for his long westward march. The camp lay on the south
bank of the swift Choaspes, in a park set apart for the
King’s use. Here were many palms and plane trees.
The Prince’s tent was erected beneath the spreading
branches of trees on the margin of the river, where in
soldierly simplicity he received the visit of the satrap.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day after his arrival at
this camp, the Prince, as was his custom, went out for
a walk. The dark peaks of the Zagros range in the
east lay bathed in the last soft rays of the sun. Shadows
were falling in the glades and upon the river. With
bent head and hands clasped behind him, he took little
note of his surroundings, until at the end of half an
hour he was met by a man, who seemed also absorbed
in meditation. This man was tall and graceful. His
body was clad in a long cloak, a plain but fine Babylonish
garment, and on his head he wore a round, black
Persian cap. His feet were shod with sandals. A full,
dark beard, streaked with gray, adorned his face. His
eagle-like countenance was strong and placid. Large
dark eyes glowed with intelligence from beneath his
heavy brows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>The Prince whose eyes were bent on the earth, was
startled from his reverie by a deep, musical voice:</p>

<p>“Hail, Prince of Iran!”</p>

<p>Involuntarily he grasped the hilt of a dagger in his
belt and gazed doubtfully a moment upon the speaker.
Then with a glad cry, he hastened forward and bending
low, exclaimed: “Hail, Belteshazzer, prophet of God!
I did not expect to meet you here! I rejoice exceedingly!
I pray your blessing!”</p>

<p>“May the Lord of all the earth bless you, my son!”
said Belteshazzer, solemnly, laying his hand upon the
Prince’s bowed head. “It is a great pleasure to behold
you again after so many months. Tell me how you
come here. Is that your army yonder? I have been
away several days in the mountains whither I go to
study, and I am now returning to the city.”</p>

<p>The Prince stood before the prophet reverently, as
one stands before a loved teacher.</p>

<p>“My guard is encamped yonder,” he answered, indicating
his camp. “We march upon the Great King’s
business to the lands beyond the Euphrates, where, it
is said, I shall find the people in rebellion. The King
has seen fit to honor me with the government of the
western provinces.”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer smiled. Knowing well the political
affairs of the empire from his long experience as adviser
to the late King and as governor of several provinces,
also knowing Cambyses and his dislike for the Prince,
he perceived the pretext which the King had used to
send the Prince far away from Iran.</p>

<p>“I had not heard of any serious disturbances in those
provinces,” he said. “It is true that some wild, turbulent
bands infest the outlying mountains on the northeast;
but the provinces have been happy under the rule of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Cyrus and have not suffered at the hands of Cambyses.
Perhaps the Great King deems it wise to scatter the
veterans of Cyrus to distant provinces!”</p>

<p>“That may be,” assented the Prince. “But you,
Teacher, why here? The governor of Medea should
not be in Elam.”</p>

<p>“I am no longer governor of Medea. The Great
King has deprived me of that office. I am no longer
an adviser to the King. I am going to Babylon to
resume my duties in the college of wise men, to spend
my time in the study of ancient records and to observe
the changing heavens, until such time as the God of
heaven and earth shall order otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Come with me!” exclaimed the Prince, impulsively.
“I shall profit by your knowledge and experience. You
shall have the chief place in my satrapy.”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, it would not be best. The Great King is very
jealous. He is scattering the men who surrounded
Cyrus and is building up a circle of his own. His
command was laid on me to proceed to Babylon, there
to reside with the college of priests. But fear not,
Prince! We shall come again in due time.”</p>

<p>“Is this a prophecy?” inquired the Prince, his countenance
alight with eagerness. “Ah, Belteshazzer! how
I have longed to obtain that power you have,—the
power to look into the future, to listen to the voice of
Shraosha and to tell that which will be! Come with me
to my tent and take refreshments. You shall stay with
me at least until I march on to my provinces. I will
consult God through you. My heart is very heavy.
Upon my soul is an oath that galls me; and I fear for
my friends and for the Aryan people under this King.
After you are refreshed, it may be you will consult the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
messengers of God and tell me the right course of
action.”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer looked upon the young man with sympathy.
Gifted beyond all living men with the power
to read souls in their nakedness, he saw here a strong,
upright spirit of good intent, in whom truth held sway,
whose mind was large enough to grapple with and solve
the problems of earth, a leader among men; and he
loved the youth. He did not answer immediately, but
looked into the eyes of the Prince earnestly as if reading
his thoughts. The Prince could not drop his gaze. Belteshazzer
presently looked away to the west, where the
last glow of the sunset still reddened the sky, and he
sighed deeply. Then his eyes swept slowly around the
horizon, resting an instant on the towers of the distant
city and then upon the tents of the army. The river’s
low murmur came up from the darkening vale mingled
with whisper of leaves moved by the breeze.</p>

<p>“I know, my son,” he said after a moment’s silence,
“that you have given an oath which may not be broken.
I read the thoughts that recur, tempting you to break it.
I read your heart and the love in it for the sister of the
King, and the brotherly love you hold towards the
brother of the King. I know that in the King’s mind
is a fierce hatred towards you and a foul intent to make
away with his brother; and that he is even now plotting
against him. I know that dark and bloody days are
impending; but the God of Spirits has guards around
you, and as long as you walk after the good intent in
your heart, you will triumph over all dangers and you
will come at length to a higher estate. More than this
I do not know.”</p>

<p>The Prince bowed his head reverently before the
speaker. In the presence of this man he was humble,—this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
man about whom wondrous stories had been told:
of his great wisdom; of his power over the spirits of
men; of the prophecies he had uttered; of the handwriting
on the wall at the close of Belshazzar’s feast, when
the great Cyrus was entering the inner city of Babylon
by the river-bed and seizing it while the people feasted;
of his immunity from fire and from the wrath of wild
beasts, which, it was said, were his friends, no matter
how savage; and of his steadfastness in the worship of
his God.</p>

<p>“O Prince of God!” he exclaimed as the prophet
ceased speaking, “I would give all that I have to hold
communion with the unseen powers as you do! I have
read the teachings of the great master, Zoroaster, and
I have listened to the wise men who have studied all that
is to be known; but, when I stand before you and listen
to your words, my soul sinks, and I wonder if I worship
the true God, or whether there are two gods, yours and
mine, or more; or whether Ahura-Mazda is but an idea.
I wish that I might sit again at your feet and learn the
whole truth!”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer looked upon the young man, with love
and admiration expressed in his large, deep eyes. His
voice when he again spoke, was full of sympathy and
fatherly kindness. “Son, there is not much to learn,
save this: that God, the Supreme Ruler of all, is one
God; that He manifests His power by His Spirit and by
His messengers; that He is known to all peoples, but
under different names and different aspects, and that He
is the Father of all. Men have forgotten Him and have
attributed to Him qualities that He has never possessed.
Some have made Him a monster, have carved Him in
wood and stone, made idols to represent Him and fallen
down before them, forgetting that God is a Spirit, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
never looks upon idolatry with allowance—forgetting,
because not seeing! But of old, when there was but one
family of men on this earth, God was known to all men.
His spirits and messengers walked and talked with men,
until men by gross and sensual lives made it impossible.
The Ancient of Days gave man a life of immortality;
breathed His own life into the first man, and he became
a living soul; made him free to live as he would, to
choose good and evil. Men, from the first days, ages
ago, lived happily, until selfishness drove them to quarrels,
to murder, and to other sins. Then they separated,
families moving hither and thither over the world, forgetting
each other; some descending into ignorance and
barbarism; others ascending to a higher state of knowledge;
all looking upon nature and clothing nature’s God
in their own vain imaginings. Some kept the knowledge
of God more perfectly than others. The Spirit of God
talks with every man, bringing up to his spirit suggestions
of better life. From time to time great teachers
are sent. So came Moses to us, the sons of Abraham
and Heber. So came Zoroaster to the Aryans. And
a day will come—I have seen it in a vision!—” here
the Prophet’s voice thrilled with awe and his eyes were
cast upward to the heavens,—“I saw in a vision one
night, years ago, before the great Cyrus overthrew Babylon,
One, like the Ancient of Days, sitting on the clouds
of heaven; and there came before him One like unto a
son of man; and to Him did the Ancient of Days give
dominion and glory over all peoples of all the earth and
all people should in all their divers languages serve Him.
His dominion is an everlasting dominion and His kingdom
shall never be destroyed. All the nations of the
earth shall serve Him gladly!”</p>

<p>He ceased a moment and stood enraptured, contemplating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the heavens and recalling again the glories of his
vision. The young man looked upon the seer’s countenance
with awe. He endeavored to gather the full meaning
of the spoken words. Whether he spoke, he knew
not, but his mind did form the question, “When shall
this be?”</p>

<p>The question came to Belteshazzer and he answered:
“I know not when, but He will come in the fullness of
time. He will not reign as kings reign, but only in the
souls of men. He will waken men to everlasting life,
men who have endeavored to do well. He will waken
others to shame of their evil lives and to everlasting contempt.
Then all men shall have full knowledge of God.
None shall fail to know their Redeemer. He will come
when God wills.”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer ceased and again sighed deeply, and for
a time gazed at the sunset glow in silence, but his eyes
saw not the glories of the sun. With his inward eyes
he was looking again at that mighty vision of which he
had spoken. The Prince broke the silence.</p>

<p>“You said that a Spirit stands guard over me and that
I shall triumph over dangers. How stands such spirit?
What is he? Why may I not see him? If I could commune
with the unseen presence, perhaps he would guide
my steps that I make no error.”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer shook his head and replied: “To some
it is given to commune with spirits, but it is only to those
whose lives are spiritual. To me it has been given to
speak with Gabriel, the messenger of God, and with
Michael, the soldier of God and leader of his hosts
against the powers of evil. It may be that God will permit
you to see. Come, let us sit down! I feel even
now the nearness of spiritual influences.”</p>

<p>They sat down side by side on a flat rock at the margin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of the river bank. Below them the bank fell away with
gentle slope to the stream. The valley was now full of
shadows. Trees and shrubs were seen as dark spots on
the dull gray of sun-scorched grass. Twilight was
rapidly deepening into darkness. Belteshazzer took the
Prince’s right hand into his left. Raising his right hand
to the heavens, he prayed inaudibly, the movement of his
lips alone indicating his action. The Prince sat motionless,
with wide eyes and bated breath. Awe entered
into his soul and a chill ran over his body, not from
fear but as if a cold current of air from the mountains
had touched him. Suddenly a light cloud of mist seemed
to come up out of the valley and from it emerged the
semblance of a stately warrior, whose countenance, seen
as in a white light, bore a striking resemblance to the
Prince’s father. His stature was above that of ordinary
man. He was clad, it seemed, in brilliant chain-mail.
A sword hung at his belt, a spear was in his hand, a bow
at his back. He stood erect with one foot advanced
and one hand outstretched as if in benediction over the
Prince’s head. Luminous, translucent, quivering with
light, yet very real, was the presence. The Prince involuntarily
raised his hand and bowed his head in salutation.
Belteshazzer sat still, calmly regarding the
vision.</p>

<p>“You may speak to him freely,” he said.</p>

<p>“Who are you that comes so gloriously?” demanded
the Prince.</p>

<p>A strong voice seemed to answer: “I am Achæmenius,
your ancestor, Prince of Iran. I am permitted by
the Supreme Power to march at your side. In you I
see the hope of the Aryans, the most worthy son of my
family. Be of good cheer! A host encamps about you.
Only seek ever after the truth and avoid the lie. Behold!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
error is creeping into the minds and hearts of the
Aryan people. Idolatry and false magic, fostered by
the evil ones, gain headway among them. It is for you
ever to strive for truth and for the knowledge of God,
the one supreme God, known to our race from the
ancient times, known to this Belteshazzer and by him
worshiped. It is your duty to restore our people to
right worship!”</p>

<p>“But what is to come? What course shall I pursue,
O glorious Spirit?”</p>

<p>“It is not given me to prophesy. Only the Supreme
One may give the spirit of prophecy. But I know that
you are chosen to be a leader and that many peoples
shall bow down before you as lord. Keep ever your
purpose to be true and truthful, to live uprightly and
justly, and to banish from among our people idolatry
and lying. More am I not permitted to say. Farewell!”</p>

<p>As suddenly as the presence had appeared, it passed
away, seeming to dissolve in thin air; and only the two
men remained, sitting side by side on the rock, with the
dark vale before them, the breeze whispering about them
and the brilliant stars above. The young man was the
first to speak. He rose and shook himself as one might
who rises from a troubled dream.</p>

<p>“Was it a vision, O Prince of God?” he demanded,
“or was it a man? Was it a spirit, or did I dream?”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer answered somewhat reproachfully:
“My son, this was no dream! You have seen a veritable
spirit, one who lived in the flesh and reigned in
Iran centuries ago. Under him marched a great army
from Bactra to Rhages and thence south into Fars,
driving out the ancient peoples and there establishing his
kingdom. I have seen this great Spirit before, when
Cyrus was King.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>The Prince exclaimed fervently: “Then it is no
fable that men who die shall live again! That which I
have heard and doubted, now I know!”</p>

<p>“Truly you have spoken! Death is but a change,
the taking off of a worn-out garment, this body of
earth. It is the release of the soul, that glorious body
within, from the trammels of mortality.”</p>

<p>“To be so glorious, it were better to die!”</p>

<p>“Nay, not till your work is done! The life now
given you is but a training for the future and should
be lived by you in such manner that men will rise up
and call you blessed.”</p>

<p>They turned towards the camp, and, walking slowly,
continued to converse upon the mysteries of life. They
passed the sentinels and soon came to the Prince’s
pavilion, where the cooks anxiously awaited their
master’s coming to his supper, long since ready. While
they supped, they continued the discussion and, long
after their meal, they sat together as teacher and pupil,
the one pouring forth wisdom from his vast store of
knowledge, the other receiving and storing it in his mind.</p>

<small>A FAREWELL FEAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAMBYSES, the King of Kings, King of the World,
made a feast at his palace in Hamadan in honor of
his brother Bardya, who, as the order announcing the
feast declared, was about to return to his future capital
and home in Bactra. All the rulers and notables of
Persia and Medea were commanded to be present on a
certain day to meet the departing Prince and to say
farewell.</p>

<p>Forty days and more had passed since the funeral of
Cyrus. The King accompanied by his brother and
sisters, had departed with all his retinue from Pasargadæ
and returned to Hamadan. Cambyses had no
love for the Persian capital, but he did love Hamadan.
At the latter city resided his boon companions, and there
the moral laws were less observed and the people cared
little what their rulers did so long as they themselves
were allowed some license.</p>

<p>Bardya had twice demanded of the King audience
without result, and finally had written to him a note stating
that he would presently return to Bactra with or
without his permission. It was then that the King had
called Prexaspes to him.</p>

<p>“Prexaspes,” he said, glowering upon him truculently,
“I expressed a wish to you concerning that sprig, Bardya,
when we talked at Pasargadæ. It seems that my wish
is forgotten!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>The King’s countenance was clouded. He held in
his hand a tablet on which was written the last message
from Bardya. He read this aloud to Prexaspes, then
dashed it to the floor with such force that the delicate
plate was shattered in bits.</p>

<p>Prexaspes was not alarmed. He had seen such
ebullitions of wrath before. “I have not forgotten the
King’s words,” he replied smoothly. “His commands
shall be obeyed. But the Prince is so closely watched
by the men of his body-guard and he so invariably refuses
to accept my invitations to visit places where the—the—accident
could happen without the people knowing
the true cause, that it has been impossible to accomplish
it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing should be impossible when the King commands!”
bellowed Cambyses. “Look to it sharp!
Here is he demanding leave to return to his kingdom.
His kingdom, indeed! His presence here is a displeasure
to me. Away with you and immediately accomplish this
task, or I will give your body to the vultures!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes bowed low in affected terror. “If the King
will permit his servant to speak, I have thought of a
plan,” he said.</p>

<p>Cambyses glared at him a moment, his bloated countenance
flushed with passion and his right hand clutching
nervously at the dagger on his thigh. It was an inner
room of the great palace and they were alone. Prexaspes
watched the madman closely, ready to flee or to
engage him in mortal combat should he attack. Beneath
his own Medean robe lurked a long, keen dagger which
he well knew how to use. But the King was not so
angry as he pretended. Seeing that his servant was
properly impressed, he said more calmly: “A plan?
Well it is that you have a plan! Speak!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“Permit me to see that no one listens or lurks near,”
suggested Prexaspes, backing towards the door. He
drew the heavy curtains and looked into the hall. He
looked out of the narrow windows into the garden.
Satisfied that no one could hear, he went close to the
King.</p>

<p>“O King, your gracious leave being given,” he said,
“I suggest that you give a great feast in honor of your
brother and that you publicly consent that he may return
to Bactra. Permit me to arrange for his departure. I
will suggest to him that he is in danger and that he flee
from this city at night. I will pretend to be his friend.
He shall arrive at no other destination than death.
There will ride out towards Rhages next day one who
looks like him so much that they cannot be distinguished
save by friends. In the desert beyond Rhages, this man
will disappear, and it will be announced that your brother
has been carried away by robbers. His friends must be
kept here by your order. Let me have your signet ring,
that I may have my orders obeyed.”</p>

<p>“Who is the man that resembles Bardya so much?”</p>

<p>“It is Gaumata, the man whose ears the great Cyrus
caused to be cut off because of his insolence.”</p>

<p>“Nay, not for any fault of his, Prexaspes, but because
my father hated and despised him. Now I think of him,
I do remember a great likeness between them. Proceed!
Here is my signet. Only see to it that I be rid of this
pestilent fellow!”</p>

<p>The King turned away, dismissing his chamberlain
with a gesture. Prexaspes at once left the room and
proceeded to his quarters in the palace, where he shut
himself in and occupied himself for some time in writing
three documents—one, an order from the King commanding
Prexaspes to slay Bardya, the King’s brother;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
one, a message to Bardya permitting him to return to
Bactra on a certain day; and, the third, a decree directing
a great feast to be held in honor of his departure. Having
sealed these with the King’s signet, Prexaspes went to
the west wing of the palace, where Bardya and his sisters
had their residence and where the King never went. He
requested the servants to inform the Prince that he bore
a message from the King.</p>

<p>Bardya was moodily pacing back and forth in the park
adjacent to the palace when the servant found him. He
was going over in his mind the details of a plan he had
formed for escape. By the King’s orders he had not
been allowed to go and come as freely in the city as he
chose. He knew that spies were constantly watching his
movements and that any attempt to escape on his part
would lead to instant arrest. He directed the servant to
bring Prexaspes to him, and presently that worthy appeared
and bowed low before him.</p>

<p>“Live forever, O Prince!” said Prexaspes. “If I
am permitted to speak, I have a message from the King.”</p>

<p>Bardya looked upon Prexaspes loftily and disdainfully.
This carefully dressed, combed and curled courtier
of the King pleased him not. This man was the
embodiment of the Mede, the luxury-loving, mixed breed
of Aryan and Semite, whom the Prince despised.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“I have here an order of the Great King directing
that you may return to your dominions one week from
to-day, and a second order that a great feast be made in
your honor and that you be sent forth properly escorted
by one hundred men under my charge.”</p>

<p>He paused. The Prince’s face lighted with joy and he
struck his hands together as he exclaimed: “Truly this
is good news, Prexaspes! How about my sisters and
companions?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“It is not ordered that they accompany you.”</p>

<p>The Prince’s face grew dark. “What?” he demanded
harshly. “Does this King deny my sisters their right to
go where they choose and does he insult me by withholding
the company of my friends?”</p>

<p>Prexaspes glanced about uneasily and placed a finger
on his lips, shaking his head warningly. He drew nearer
to the Prince, saying in a low voice: “Have a care,
Prince Bardya! The King waits only for some excuse
and for a convenient day, to slay you. I will reveal to
you what I know. Swear to keep silent should you
escape! Give me the royal word of an Achæmenian
that you will not betray me and that when you come to
your kingdom you will remember me as a King should.
Then will I reveal what is planned to compass your
death.”</p>

<p>Bardya hesitated. He searched the dark countenance
of Prexaspes, striving to penetrate the mask of earnestness
there assumed.</p>

<p>“You have my word. Speak!” he said after some
hesitation.</p>

<p>“I am indeed commanded to lead you with the escort
of one hundred men toward Rhages, but it is also ordered
that you be slain before you reach that city. I am not
willing to stain my hands in the royal blood of Iran.
Neither am I willing that my head pay the forfeit of
failing to have the King’s orders obeyed. Therefore,
believe me, I have planned in good faith for your escape.
On the night before the day set for your departure, the
feast will be held. You must attend the feast. At midnight
there will be a great exhibition of magic by the
priests of the Magi. The King will be drunk by that
time and engrossed with watching the performances.
You will then have opportunity to leave the assembly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
room unnoticed by him and to return to your apartments.
I will see that the guards are removed. You will take
what jewels you have and leave your apartments to meet
me at the western gate of the park, where horses will
await us. Wear a rough soldier’s cloak over your armor.
It will be easy for us to pass the guards and leave the
city, as I shall have the pass-words. I will accompany
you beyond the city limits on the northern road. I will
put money in your saddle-bags and you may travel as a
merchant. As soon as you are beyond the city I will
return. Next day, there will ride forth one who much
resembles you and who will dress as you dress,—Gaumata,
the Magian. He will ride beyond Rhages. He
will there disappear, and those who allow him to escape
will feel the wrath of the Great King. Meanwhile you
may travel unnoticed to Bactra. Is it not a good plan?”</p>

<p>Bardya listened with distrust. He did not answer immediately.
He pondered, not the plan, but the man who
proposed it. As if reading his thoughts, Prexaspes
added: “Why need you distrust me? If I chose to
slay you, could I not come with the King’s order, take
you to the dungeons, and there have you slain? Why
should I make this plan? Surely you do not fear that
I am able, single-handed, to overcome you on the northern
road,—you, than whom no stronger swordsman rides
a Nicæan steed! You will be armed and have a coat of
mail. You may take all precautions. I seek only to do
you a service.”</p>

<p>His words touched the Prince’s vanity. Of course he
feared no single man, he the celebrated strong-arm Prince
of the world! The desire for liberty was strong in him
and the romance of a night escape appealed to him.</p>

<p>“Prexaspes, I agree,” he said. “It matters little
whether you speak truly or falsely. It will be better to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
try an escape than to remain here; and, should the King
overtake me with his guards, I can no more than die.
Should I escape by this plan, come to me at Bactra and
I will reward you royally. Or better still, times and
seasons may change and Kings may change; and if
Ahura-Mazda be willing, I may be here again some day
able to give great honors and rewards!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes smiled beneath his curly beard. His snake-like
eyes flashed. “Let it be settled, then,” he rejoined.
“At the midnight hour, return to your apartments, not
letting any of your friends know your purpose. Meet
me at the western park gate alone, and we will ride forth
alone. Leave word with your servants that you are
tired and are not to be called until the noon hour on the
morrow. Farewell for the present!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes turned away and disappeared through the
shrubbery. The Prince paced onward till he came to the
western limits of the park and noted the gate of which
Prexaspes had spoken. He also saw that a company of
soldiers had their tents pitched among the trees beyond
the gate and that certain of them as guards paced back
and forth along the wall bounding the park. He turned
on his heel and returned to the palace. The guards
watched him as long as he was in sight and murmured
to each other concerning him, their attitude being sympathetic.
The Prince was a man of soldierly figure and
gracious demeanor. These men would go far to execute
the orders of the King of Kings, but they admired the
Prince and would not willingly have harmed him.</p>

<p>The Prince walked slowly, his mind revolving the plan
suggested for his escape, his head bent and his eyes cast
down. He did not see his sister, Athura, coming towards
him until he heard her soft voice.</p>

<p>“Brother, why so downcast? Why so thoughtful and
preoccupied?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>His countenance lighted with pleasure. There existed
between these two a sincere affection. He leaned much
upon this sister, whose mind, like that of her great
father, was acute and whose judgment was sound.</p>

<p>“How beautiful is my sister!” he said, quoting one of
the poets—“Fairer than all the women of earth, more
to be beloved than wealth! Her breath is as fragrant
as the breath of the rose; her eyes are deeper than the
dark vault of heavens at night; her heart is as pure as
the white snow on Demavend!”</p>

<p>“Wait till you behold some maiden who will find
favor in your sight! Then your sister will be remembered
only as your very good friend and your songs of
praise will be another’s,” she said. “Did I not see that
man, Prexaspes, with you a moment ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Princess. I have something to tell you. Let
us go yonder to that seat beneath the oak tree. It is
apart from all others, so that no one may overhear.”</p>

<p>They went to a rustic seat beneath the spreading
branches of a great oak and sat down side by side, and
he related all that Prexaspes had said.</p>

<p>“What do you advise?” he asked.</p>

<p>Athura listened closely, her countenance expressing
distrust, surprise, and incredulity. She took from the
wide belt, that gathered her beautiful robe loosely about
her waist, a small roll of papyrus.</p>

<p>“Here is a letter from my Prince which has somewhat
to say of this danger you are in,” she said. “I advise
that you distrust Prexaspes.”</p>

<p>Bardya looked over her shoulder as she unfolded the
paper. “‘<i>Fairest and best of all maidens, Princess of
my soul</i>,’” he read aloud laughingly.</p>

<p>Athura quickly turned the first portion of the letter
under, saying, “You would joke if death were about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
seize you! You shall not read the sweet things he has
written. You know not the meaning of them, even if
you did believe yourself in love with the daughter of
Orobates.”</p>

<p>Bardya in pretended anger placed his hand over her
mouth. “Let not that be mentioned!” he exclaimed,
with simulated sternness. “I was sixteen and she was
very fair. Though she was the daughter of a groom,
even yet I sigh for her.”</p>

<p>Having found that part of the letter which she desired
to read, Athura said: “Listen to what my Prince
says. This was written thirty days ago and was sent to
his mother’s house, where he supposed I would be and
where I should have been but for a bear of a brother
who is King. Listen!</p>

<p>“‘I have been much troubled concerning the words
of that great teacher, your father’s former counselor,
Belteshazzer, the Hebrew. He is a prophet, acquainted
with all wisdom, speaking face to face with the messengers
of God. He showed me a vision on the day we
halted near Susa. He had been in the wilderness near
by and was returning to the city, when I met him on the
bank of the Choaspes. He showed me a vision of
Achæmenius, the common ancestor of our royal family,
yours and mine. A glorious vision! Belteshazzer can
read all minds and knows what is in the hearts of men;
and he said that the King meditated harm to Prince
Bardya. Therefore, I beseech you, my soul, that you
advise Bardya to escape as soon as he may and return
to Bactra, where he will be safe.</p>

<p>“‘I am now at Damascus, the chief city of Syria, resting
before we continue to Sardis. I hear nothing of
wars in the realms I go to govern, save the depredations
of certain wild tribes on the northeastern border. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
look forward to lonely days without you. I may find
opportunity to subdue the Ionian cities, which are far
too independent and do not properly recognize the
majesty of Iran. Till I hear from you I—’”</p>

<p>Athura paused and replaced the letter in her belt, saying,
“The rest is for me alone.”</p>

<p>Bardya sat dreamily listening to the rustle of the
breeze in the oak leaves and gazing at the dark ridges
of Mount Elwend in the west. “I have never thought
much of visions, prophecies, or wonder-working performers
who deceive the eye by quick movements,” he
said after a moment of silence. “Darius says there is
a future life; that the soul, leaving this body as one
leaves a worn-out cloak, passes into the unseen world
and continues to live; that Ahura-Mazda is a God in
very truth and that He sends messengers to earth.
Darius is wise and learned. If there is a future life and
if congenial spirits hover round us, then indeed must
those spirits who surround the King be all devils! His
savage mind is blinded by love of power and moved to
murder by jealousy and fear of me, his brother. I remember
Belteshazzer, when he was a great and trusted
counselor of Cyrus, our father. I feared him, too; and
no man who ever looked into his reproving eye could do
otherwise than fear him. I wish I could know the mind
of Prexaspes. He seemed sincere. I will go with him
and trust to my own arm for protection. But, sweet
sister, I fear to leave you here in the power of my
brother. Can you not flee with me?”</p>

<p>“Fear not for me, brother. Cambyses will not harm
me. He has no excuse. I am not in line for the throne.
The right to rule goes to the male descendants of the
Achæmenian family. I must not leave Artistone.
How can I go now? I should hinder you. Besides, I
must wait here for my Prince.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Bardya did not argue with her further, and she did not
oppose his plan of escape further.</p>

<p>The feast day came. There gathered into the great
assembly hall of the palace a thousand of the notables
of earth to honor the departure of Prince Bardya to his
realms. Prexaspes had spared no expense in adorning
the palace and in preparing the feast and the entertainments
that should accompany it. The many pillars
shining with burnished gold plate, which supported the
gilded beams of the palace roof, were festooned with
garlands of flowers, interwoven with streamers and
bunting of many colors. The heavy tapestries of the
doors in the assembly room were drawn back with silver
chains. Across one end of this room a table was set,
from the ends of which extended two longer tables in
such manner that the King, when sitting at the center
of the first, could see all his guests before him. Those
he delighted to honor would sit at his table; others of
less consequence would occupy the others. Snowy linen
covers were laid. Heavy dishes of gold and silver, jars
of beautiful Samos pottery, and vases from Egypt and
Greece were put in place on them. Apples, peaches,
plums, grapes, pomegranates, figs, and other rare and
luscious fruits were heaped on shining platters. Confections,
sweet cakes, nuts, salads, and relishes were in
profusion. Flowers filled the air with delicious odors.
Magnificent couches, on which the feasters might sit or
recline as they chose, were placed along the tables. At
one side of the room facing the King’s place was a low
platform with seats for musicians, who with divers musical
instruments would furnish sounds more or less harmonious
while the great ones feasted. In adjacent
rooms, graceful dancers, supple tricksters, and athletes
were waiting to go in before the King and perform. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
thousand servants, cooks, tasters, waiters, and attendants
made ready the feast.</p>

<p>As the sun disappeared behind the western mountains,
a fanfare of trumpets announced that the feast was
ready, and thousands of candles were lighted in the great
banquet-room. None of those invited had failed to
come. The King’s invitation was regarded as a command.
In the cloak-room adjacent to the banquet-room,
each guest received a purple robe to be worn
during the feast and to be carried away by him at its
close.</p>

<p>At the appointed moment Prexaspes, as ruler of the
feast, appeared, gorgeously dressed and having in his
hand a wand. As the guests entered he indicated the
seats to be occupied by them, placing them according to
their rank. At the King’s table sat Crœsus, late king of
Lydia, a prisoner, but an honored guest. There sat also
Nebuchadezzer, Prince of Nineveh, and a score of
other princes whose dominions were no longer theirs to
rule, but who, though prisoners of the King of Kings,
sat at his table and showed to the world that they lived
on his bounty. When all had been duly placed, they
remained standing with faces turned towards the throne
at one end of the room and awaited the coming of the
King. At the left of the throne was a door covered by
heavy purple curtains hanging from ceiling to floor.</p>

<p>Having placed all the guests, Prexaspes touched a
cord and the tinkle of a bell announced the coming of
royalty. The curtains of the door near the throne were
parted and disclosed the King advancing, followed by
his brother, his wife, and his two sisters, the women
being closely veiled. The King strode heavily forward,
his swarthy countenance lowering and his black eyes
sweeping over the guests. All the guests bowed low towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
him. He sat down heavily at his table. The
guests remained standing until Prince Bardya, his sisters,
and the King’s wife had taken their places at the
King’s table. Then, at a wave of Prexaspes’ wand,
the guests sank upon their seats. Immediately, nimble
servants with pitchers and goblets appeared from side
doors and poured wine for each guest. The King’s cup-bearer
stood with a great cup of Helbon wine at the
side of his master. The King seized the cup and, after
waving it slightly toward his guests, drank from it long
and deeply. The guests also drank. The musicians
took their places and began playing a weird melody,
monotonous and long-drawn-out, with many repetitions
and variations. A murmur of conversation arose.</p>

<p>Servants brought on trays of smoking meat, of delicious
vegetables and pastries, and for each guest the
food to which he was accustomed, prepared to suit his
taste. The King ate and drank in silence, not even
addressing a word to his wife, who sat at his right hand.
Bardya and the royal sisters ate little. Their hearts
were full of anxiety over the proposed escape of the
Prince. But the King drank much wine. He also
called for soma and drank of that liquor deeply. And
as he drank, he watched Prexaspes, who ever moved
nervously about the room directing the feast. Would
the elegant Mede fail? The King began to devise a
sufficient punishment to inflict on him should he fail.
Dancers were brought in after the feast had well begun
and gave an exhibition of sinuous movement, like the
curving of a snake’s folds, or the graceful undulations
of the sea waves. After the dancers there were
performances by jugglers, mountebanks, and tricksters,
and athletes displayed their strength and agility in wrestling-bouts.
At the close of the feast, Prexaspes stood in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the midst and called for silence. Then he said, “O
King, by your gracious permission, I will now bring in
the Magians who hold communion with the spirits of
the departed, who have control of the powers of the
gods, and who will divine and prophesy for you, besides
doing many other wonderful things.”</p>

<p>The faces of all were turned upon the King; and only
on the countenances of the Persian nobles and the faces
of Bardya and his sisters was disapproval written.</p>

<p>“Let them come in with their tricks,” said the King,
sneeringly. “They may delude us, but they will not
convince us. Let them come!”</p>

<p>“Let the lights be partially extinguished!” commanded
Prexaspes.</p>

<p>Immediately servants extinguished the candles, except
a few at the King’s table, and semi-darkness enveloped
them all. Then a band of six Magians entered. Servants
brought in a heavy square table and set it in the
open space between the dining tables. Others brought
in some small tablets and balls, which were placed
on the table. The magicians prostrated themselves before
the King in salutation and afterwards gathered around
the square table in silence and joined hands. They were
clad in black robes, which covered their bodies in loose
folds from their necks down. Their hands were visible
below the wide sleeves of the robes, and their pallid
faces shone dead white in the semi-gloom below the dark
turbans wound loosely around their heads.</p>

<p>As soon as the lights were extinguished, the King
turned his back upon Bardya as if weary of his presence.
Then a hand touched Bardya on the shoulder, and, turning,
he saw Prexaspes who beckoned with a nod
and disappeared into the gloom of a side chamber.
Bardya waited a moment until the attention of all was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
concentrated upon the group of magicians; then, after
pressing Athura’s hand lightly, he rose and quietly followed
Prexaspes. The King seemed not to notice his
movements, but was really watching.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the Prince, wrapped in a soldier’s
cloak, stole out through the park, met Prexaspes there
alone, mounted a horse held by him in readiness, passed
through the park, and rode away with him through the
city towards the northern road. When clear of the city
environs, they spurred away at a gallop side by side
towards the city of Rhages lying at the foot of distant
Mount Demavend.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the King’s presence, many wonderful
things were happening. After several minutes of
silence on the part of the Magians, the heavy table
around which they stood rose to the ceiling without apparent
supporting hands and there remained several
minutes. Balls of light floated about the room near the
ceiling. A tree sprang up out of the floor and visibly
grew till its top touched the suspended table. Then the
table slowly circled about the room, returned, and settled
down to the floor. The tree disappeared as it settled.
Upon the table, immediately, a mass of writhing snakes
appeared, hissing and shooting forth angry red tongues,
so that the guests were about to rise and flee in terror.
They disappeared. The voice of the chief magician said
in sepulchral tones:</p>

<p>“None of these mighty wonders will bring harm to
any of you, unless you make a noise and attempt to flee.
Remain quietly in your places and behold the wonders of
the gods! Know that the spirits of the mountains and
of the valleys and of the plains are here, the rulers of
earth, whom we serve. Know that there is no other religion
worthy of practice than ours. Let the Great King
behold and act accordingly!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>The voice ceased and a hush fell over the assembly.
The King moved uneasily in his seat, and answered in
loud, sarcastic tones: “Tricksters have existed in all
nations and in all ages! Your spirits are lying spirits
conjured up in your own minds to frighten superstitious
men. Bah! There are gods and gods! Show me a
spirit!”</p>

<p>“It is well!” answered the magician. “We obey the
King of Kings. Only say nothing and move not!”</p>

<p>A deep hush fell upon the assembly. The group of
magicians drew together again and formed a circle
about the table, placing their joined hands upon it and
bowing their heads. Only the chief stood as if in a
trance, looking upward. Then, above the heads of the
group a pallid, misty light suddenly appeared, growing
in density and assuming shape, until it became the shape
of a man, wavering, translucent, with a sneering, evil
countenance and sinister eyes, such as are ever ascribed
to evil spirits. The King drew in his breath sharply
and bent forward startled and alarmed. A voice seemed
to come from the spirit:</p>

<p>“What would you ask, O King of the Earth?”</p>

<p>For a moment the King could not reply. He was
agitated beyond measure. He summoned all his
bravado, and with a great effort stammered, “Who and
what are you?”</p>

<p>A derisive smile curled the features of the apparition,
as the voice replied: “I am your soul’s companion,
the spirit that goes with you wherever you go! I
am your evil genius! I am—you!”</p>

<p>Rage filled the heart of the King.</p>

<p>“This trick shall not benefit you, O Magians!” he
shouted. “Prove to me that this is no delusion or death
shall be your portion!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Demand of me any proof, O King!” responded the
voice.</p>

<p>“Make your own proof!” retorted the King.</p>

<p>Again the derisive smile curled the devilish features
of the apparition, while a shivering silence possessed
the wondering guests, who looked from it to the King
and from the King to it, astonished at the resemblance
between them.</p>

<p>“At midnight, O King, last night,” said the apparition
in a sepulchral tone, “I walked with you on the
portico at the door of your bedroom and your thoughts
were of your father and of your brother. Did you hear
the whispering in the plane-tree? The thought then in
your mind has been accomplished; and there comes
hither the spirit of him that troubled you!”</p>

<p>The apparition seemed to turn about and look in fear
to the north; then, suddenly, it faded away. A groan
arose from the chief Magian. He stirred uneasily and
turned his pallid face towards the north. His hands
were clenched and he stared into space with terror-stricken
gaze. Deathlike hush pervaded the great hall.
Then slowly and waveringly there appeared in the place
where the former apparition had stood a ghastly face;
and it was the image of Bardya, the King’s brother.
With fierce eyes it glared down upon the King; and it
seemed that blood poured down over the forehead in a
trickling stream from a deep cleft in the crown of its
head.</p>

<p>A shriek of terrified anguish arose from the Princesses.
A chorus of exclamations broke from the guests.
The apparition suddenly disappeared. The King sat as
if stunned for a moment, looking fixedly at the point
where the apparition had been, while his face was contorted
with fear and horror. The Magians silently dissolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
their circle and quickly disappeared. The lights
flared up as servants ran hither and thither relighting
the candles. The King arose unsteadily. The guests
arose and stood in their places while he wearily moved,
or rather tottered, to the door by which he had entered,
and disappeared. The sisters, supporting each other and
weeping, left the room. The guests then broke into
noisy comment and wonder and proceeded to fortify
their shaken nerves with wine. Orthodox Persians
muttered curses on all Magians. The unorthodox
shook their heads and superstitiously resolved to make
sacrifices on the morrow to the spirits of the hills and to
the gods of the Magians. Arguments arose for and
against Magism; but the advocates of that cult had the
better of it, since as all had seen, it was capable of ocular
demonstration. But the orthodox said it was the religion
of devils; as for them, they would continue to
worship the Good Spirit! Besides, the latter said, it
was evident a fraud had been perpetrated, because Bardya,
the King’s brother, had been at the feast well and
alive. How could this apparition have been his ghost?
In this argument they had the best of it. But they marveled
at the King’s agitation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>THE GREAT KING INTRODUCES A STRANGE CUSTOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Great King was much shaken by the strange
apparitions which the Magi had conjured up; but
he assured himself that the whole performance had been
trickery and he fiercely planned vengeance upon the
performers. He had always boasted of his disbelief in
gods and spirits, though puzzled sometimes at the magic
of the fire-worshipers. This time, however, his gross
nature had received a severe shock and while he awaited
the return of Prexaspes that he might learn how his
brother had been dealt with, he drank deep potations of
soma and half-wished that his brother were indeed alive
so that the horrid vision might be proven false. He
paced back and forth impatiently in his apartments,
while his servants stood without, breathlessly watching
for every command lest in his present mood delay on
their part would entail upon them grave consequences.</p>

<p>A horseman galloped through the silent city from the
north shortly before daylight and, with a hasty word to
a sleepy guard, passed through the walls into the park
and thence to the stables at the rear of the palace.
Leaving his horse in the care of servants, he entered the
palace. It was Prexaspes. After a few minutes in his
own apartments, he emerged clad in his elegant court
dress and went to the King’s apartments, where he knew
the King waited. A servant announced his presence and
he was at once admitted to the King’s presence. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
entered, closed the door behind him, and stood before
the King with bowed head.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded the King, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“The King’s orders have been obeyed.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“A sword-stroke from behind as we rode northward.
The body has been safely disposed. Let the King be at
peace. Bardya is no more!”</p>

<p>“Swear to me by all that you deem holy! Did the
sword cut penetrate the brow?”</p>

<p>“It did. I swear by all the gods of the hills and valleys,
by Ahriman and by the spirits of my fathers!”</p>

<p>The King shuddered. Mingled relief and fear shone
in his countenance.</p>

<p>“I have had strange proof of the truth of your words,
Prexaspes,” he said. “Surely you are in league with
devils! I knew you belonged to the Magian sect, but I
did not know their power. How did they know the
manner of Bardya’s death? How could they show it?”</p>

<p>Prexaspes smiled. He had learned what had transpired
before the King.</p>

<p>“Without their aid it would have been impossible to
have accomplished the destruction of the Prince,” he
answered. “It would be well if the Great King should
show favor to the Magi. They can help him much.
With the assistance of the diviners and those who have
familiar spirits, who can speak with the spirits of the
dead and with the gods of the hills, the King will be
able to detect those who might plot against his life.
Nothing can be done but what they may find it out if
they desire. They help and protect their friends.”</p>

<p>“But they worship the Lie, which from all ages has
been proscribed by the laws of Iran,” said the King,
doubtfully. “I know they have power to perform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
wonders; but I deem them tricks. What care I? If
their tricks aid me, they shall be rewarded.”</p>

<p>“It is right for the Great King thus to speak for the
ears of the people!” returned Prexaspes, insinuatingly.
“But if the Great King does practice all the good precepts
of Ahura-Mazda, what avails it or how does it
benefit him? I dare to speak plainly, so that you may
receive the aid of the powerful Magi whose followers
are more numerous than all others in Medea, Assyria,
and Babylonia. The deed done at your command this
night has been accomplished by their aid. The men of
orthodox faith, the worshipers of Ahura-Mazda, hate
you. Only by allying yourself with the Magi can you
hope to retain your throne. With their aid you may
defy your enemies if they should learn of Bardya’s end.
Ally yourself with the Magi and their gods and they will
gratify all your wishes. Know, O King, that these men
have wonderful powers, even greater than the priests of
Egypt or of Babylon who know some of their arts.”</p>

<p>Cambyses was shaken. In him there was some good.
Unconsciously his physical passions had been overcoming
the good; but, occasionally, there broke through the
density of his grosser nature an inward voice urging
him to a better life. But he had no doubt of his absolute
right to do as he might will, and he had come to
believe that ordinary rules of right and wrong did not
apply to him. Prexaspes, seeing the King’s hesitation,
continued:</p>

<p>“Let not my words arouse resentment, O King! I
seek but to do you good. My own welfare depends
upon your will. I can call to your aid the Magi and the
unseen powers. In their circle I stand next to Patatheites,
the High Priest. Have I not obeyed your will
and removed from your path the greatest danger to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
your rule? Trust me still further and you shall continue
to have true service. Give to the Magi the chief
right to exercise religious power throughout the world,
and their vast power will keep you safely. Make now
an alliance with them and it shall be well with you.”</p>

<p>The King paced back and forth across the room, debating
the matter. Hating all religions, because he
wished to disbelieve them, his long-standing prejudices
were not easily moved.</p>

<p>“If I do not make this compact, then what?” he
asked presently.</p>

<p>“If you are abandoned by them, how shall you receive
any aid?” rejoined Prexaspes. “Certainly you
can expect nothing of the followers of Zoroaster!
They have the power and the will to do you hurt. But,
through me, the Magi offer you their powerful aid. Believe
me, O King, it will be your only wise course to
accept their support.”</p>

<p>Cambyses nervously stroked his beard. He was not
a coward. No one had ever accused him of a lack of
courage. He despised the orthodox faith because of
its moral laws, and he hated its followers. But he recognized
the strength of the argument advanced by
Prexaspes. The Magian sect was a powerful one.
Medea, Assyria, Babylon, Syria, and Phrygia were full
of them. They claimed to be in league and communion
with the gods of the earth, and indeed practiced the
occult arts, known more or less to all peoples, and in
modern days followed by some so-called spiritualists.
All of them were not evil. Many of them were reputed to
be the prophets and seers and warned the people against
the evil men who made use of their arts for their own advancement.
Stringent laws had been made and enforced
throughout Iran against that branch which attacked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
doctrines of Zoroaster. But this cult had flourished
especially in the mountains of Medea. Fire-worshipers
fed their sacred flames on every hilltop. The evil
and depraved gathered to them and harassed those who
opposed them. They were known to the orthodox as
worshipers of the “Lie,” to distinguish them from those
who worshiped the “Truth,” as embodied in Ahura-Mazda.
Cambyses had sometimes consulted the Magians
and required oracles of them. His father had
severely reprimanded him for such practices and had
caused the ears of Gaumata, one of the leaders of the
Magi at Hamadan, to be cut off as a warning to him
and to his sect that Cambyses should not be influenced
by them.</p>

<p>Cambyses reviewed these matters as he paced nervously
back and forth, while Prexaspes awaited his decision
with bowed head and downcast eyes. He decided
to comply.</p>

<p>“So be it! Only let everything be done in a politic
way!” he exclaimed harshly. “I will make a league
with the Magi. They shall have freedom to worship as
long as I rule. They must nevertheless obey me. I will
be King alone and will not permit interference. But the
laws against them shall be annulled and I will favor
them with offices.”</p>

<p>“It is well!” said Prexaspes, bending low and touching
the floor with his hands. “Now, if the Great King
will permit, I will withdraw and will carry out our plan
to deceive the populace into the belief that Bardya still
lives in the flesh.”</p>

<p>The King nodded and turned away. Prexaspes, with
a smirk of triumph on his face, left the room. Passing
out into the hall, he was about to go to his room, when
a servant approached and, after a low salutation, said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
“Noble Prexaspes, my royal mistress, the Princess
Athura, commands that you come to her waiting-room.
She would speak with you.”</p>

<p>Prexaspes hesitated a moment. Then, drawing his
breath sharply, as if bracing himself to a severe task,
and assuming a cheerful demeanor, he followed the servant.
Athura and her sister had not retired to
their beds after the banquet. The departure of Bardya,
followed by the fearful scene produced by the Magi,
had rendered them sleepless. They had ordered their
servants to watch for and report the return of Prexaspes
to them. Prexaspes entered the room where they
awaited him and bowed very low before them, touching
the floor with his hands. Then he stood in respectful
attitude with downcast eyes, awaiting their pleasure.
The eyes of the maidens were red with weeping.</p>

<p>“Speak, false traitor! Was it you that struck
Bardya and slew him?” exclaimed Athura, approaching
him with clenched hands and blazing eyes.</p>

<p>Prexaspes raised his brows in well-simulated surprise.</p>

<p>“You wrong me greatly, most noble Princess! What
mean you? No one has slain Bardya,” he answered.</p>

<p>“But I saw his spirit! He appeared at the close of
the feast, and his head was cleft in twain as with a
sword-stroke!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes smiled reassuringly, and drawing nearer to
the Princess he whispered: “Believe it not, O most
royal! That was but a delusion to convince the Great
King that his will had been done. How could a spirit
appear with cleft head? Spirits have no bodies that
may be seen. But Patatheites was able to influence all
there so that they believed they saw the spirit of Bardya,
while the great Prince was riding swift as the wind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Rhages. Dry your tears! Bardya is beyond the reach
of the King now, and in due time you will hear that he
has arrived in his dominions. You saw no spirit. It
was but a picture from the mind of the Magian chief.”</p>

<p>So sincere were his words and manner that Athura
was reassured. She never had been superstitious or believed
that the Magi were other than tricksters. The
sternness left her countenance. She smiled graciously
and extended her hand, which Prexaspes on bended
knee respectfully kissed while his brilliant eyes glowed
with admiration. Never, he thought at that moment,
had he seen so beautiful a face or so perfect a form,
never such a gracious and winning smile. For a moment
his heart, used to the ways of the world, satiated
with the pleasures of life, leaped within him; and he felt
that to deserve that gracious smile he would have undone
all that he had done and given up all that he had
won. The music of her voice and the sweetness of her
smile dwelt with him many a day thereafter, bringing to
him the only regret and shame that he had ever known
since childhood.</p>

<p>“Noble Prexaspes,” she said, “I recall my harsh
words! But that was a horrible thing the great magician
showed us; and it was well thought of to deceive
the King! Surely my brother and I will reward you in
days to come when all danger shall have been removed.
As you have this night served Bardya, I promise on the
word of an Achæmenian, which has never been broken,
you will have a fitting and suitable reward. Farewell!”</p>

<p>Bowing many times, Prexaspes backed from the room
and passed hastily to his own quarters. The sisters, relieved
of their apprehension, retired to rest.</p>

<p>Next day there was much excitement in the city of
Hamadan. A great crowd gathered along the northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
road to shout a farewell to Bardya, the beloved. Their
greetings to him who impersonated Bardya, when he
appeared riding in the midst of a group of nobles, bowing
right and left, were hearty and prolonged. Prexaspes
rode at his side, smiling cynically beneath his
beard and glancing occasionally up at the great palace
on the hill where the King stood at a window gazing
down upon the demonstration. The false Bardya
passed out of the city; and so perfect was his resemblance
to the departed in feature and dress that none
suspected the imposture. At Rhages, a new escort was
provided; but at a point a day’s journey beyond Rhages
it was attacked by a band of men, supposed to be robbers,
and scattered. Bardya, whether true or false,
there disappeared and the Great King sent a punitive
expedition into the mountains to lay waste the robbers’
homes. Certain innocent mountaineers suffered the
Great King’s vengeance, but the King’s brother could
not be found.</p>

<p>Thus did Cambyses make himself sure of his throne,
and for many months thereafter he gave himself up to
riotous living, seeking in strong drink forgetfulness of
his crime. Meanwhile he prepared for war against
Egypt. He levied heavy taxes and called for troops
from every province. His pride grew. He deemed
himself divine. The Magi encouraged him in this faith
and brought messages from the gods of the hills to him
as the god of earth.</p>

<p>Cambyses had one great sorrow. He was childless.
He took many women as wives. His seraglio was filled
with the most beautiful of the earth. But no child
gladdened his heart. As the months passed, his mind
became darker and more imbued with hatred of good
and the love of evil. The Magi served him well. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
his spies they listened among the common people and
invaded the palaces of the great. He knew that the
people feared him and did not love him. His vanity
was easily wounded. Some who spoke offensively of
him to putative friends suddenly disappeared and were
never heard of more. Throughout the vast regions governed
by him, his spies watched for plots and conspiracies.
Incipient rebellions were ferociously repressed
and those who plotted were tortured to death as examples
to others.</p>

<p>Reviewing these things in his mind one day, while
walking on the balcony of the palace, the King looked
down upon the park surrounding the palace and noticed
a group of women sitting on benches beneath a tree, and
saw that among them were his two sisters. Their gay
chatter and laughter came up to his ears. He watched
them a moment in scowling silence, and was about to
resume his walk, when, as he turned, he was startled at
seeing before him the tall form of Patatheites, chief
priest of the Magians. The King uttered an oath, and
placed his hand on the haft of his dagger.</p>

<p>“How come you here?” he growled. “I like not this
sudden appearing! I turn here or there and I behold
you and know not how you come or go! Speak,
slave!”</p>

<p>The large, dark eyes of the Magian looked calmly
into the fierce, sparkling orbs of the King; and before
his direct gaze the latter quailed. Possessed of wonderful
hypnotic power, Patatheites easily ruled those
with whom he came in contact. He dared even to exercise
his power upon the King.</p>

<p>“Let not the King’s anger strike me!” he said soothingly.
“I am his most obedient and willing slave. I
have a message from the gods, who have seen fit to
whisper it to me for you.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“What is it?” demanded the King, cringing somewhat
and experiencing a chill along his spinal column.</p>

<p>“Your expedition against Egypt will be successful,
say the gods of the hills. Concerning that which you
had in your mind as to an heir for your throne, I have
a message also.”</p>

<p>Cambyses looked upon the man with growing awe.
To no one had he ever expressed the thoughts concerning
his lack of an heir. How could this priest know that
he had just been considering that subject?</p>

<p>“How knew you my thoughts?” he demanded.
“What is this message?”</p>

<p>“How do the gods know?” returned the Magian.
“This message is, that one of your race shall fill your
throne after you, but it will be a son of your sister.”</p>

<p>“What?” almost shouted the King. “Her son? and
who shall be his father?”</p>

<p>“That I know not. But I do know that it lies in your
power to say who shall be husband to your sisters. Look
about over the world and choose one equal to yourself.”</p>

<p>Cambyses was silent a moment and his thought ran
to one only who might claim to be of equal birth, the
Prince of Iran. Jealous wrath arose and almost choked
his utterance.</p>

<p>“There is none,” he stuttered, “unless it might be
that accursed Hystaspis!”</p>

<p>The Magian nodded meaningly.</p>

<p>“Even now,” said he, “she has in her bosom a letter
from him which she is instructed to deliver to you, demanding
that you give her leave to go to him and marry
him. She will present this request. What then?”</p>

<p>“She shall not go to him! Instead I will send him
a bowstring in the hands of our trusty servants.”</p>

<p>Patatheites shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“No, it would mean your overthrow. The Persians
and Bactrians are restless because you have seen fit to
give freedom to the Magi; and they only await a leader
to rise against you. They yet look for Bardya to return
and raise the standard of rebellion. They think
you have him imprisoned. If he could return they
would that instant join him. If harm befall the Prince
of Iran, remember that his old lion of a father reigns
at Bactra, and that he has three hundred thousand of
Cyrus’s veterans under his immediate command. The
son is the apple of the old man’s eye, the center of his
soul; and, in spite of his oath to Cyrus, which pledged
him to your support, he would tear even you from
your throne should you harm the Prince. You have
nothing to fear from that young man. His oath binds
him to you. He is such a stickler for faith and truth
that he will not break it, even though you should refuse
him the hand of your sister. But there is a plan
whereby you may move in accordance with the advice
of the gods, yet inflict on that Prince most grievous suffering
if you will.”</p>

<p>“What is this plan? I would go far to harass him.
What mean you?”</p>

<p>“The King has two sisters, both fair to look upon.
There is none in all the world to equal them in birth
save the King. Why not do as the ancient Egyptian
kings used to do—marry these two sisters yourself?”</p>

<p>Cambyses stared at his interlocutor with open mouth.
Such an idea had never entered his brain. It was contrary
to Aryan law that one should marry any one closer
than a cousin in blood relationship. He swore a great
oath of astonishment. He looked down at his sisters,
the one in all the glory of well-developed womanhood,
the other just emerging from childhood to womanhood,
both beautiful and of royal carriage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Which of these sisters shall mother a king?” he
demanded of the Magian, presently.</p>

<p>“It was not said. But why should the King choose?
Is not the King of Kings above the laws of the Medes
and Persians and may he not do as he will? Is not the
King’s word and his decree law? If the King decree
that he marry both his sisters, is it not law? Bah!
The customs of the Aryans must give way to your divine
will. I have spoken. Let the King act on my
advice!”</p>

<p>The King was silent. He contemplated his sisters.
He turned again to the Magian, but the latter had disappeared.
He looked about. He had not heard him go.
This uncanny habit of Patatheites in appearing and disappearing
at will made the King shiver. This new idea
of taking his sisters in marriage, however, was a
novel one and worthy of thought. He slowly descended
by steps from the balcony to the earth and walked towards
the group of women. As soon as the latter noticed
his approach, there was a hasty movement among
the women, some of whom departed. The sisters of
the King arose as he approached, and stood in respectful
attitude.</p>

<p>“Hail, sisters!” he said, attempting to speak graciously.
“I trust you are enjoying this pleasant
weather. Winter approaches and we shall soon go
down to Susa.”</p>

<p>They bowed in reply. He looked them over critically.
Yes, they were very beautiful. The younger he
did not dislike so much as the elder. He had hated the
elder with the same jealous hatred that he had felt towards
his brother; but the younger had been a child and
had not incurred his displeasure, nor had she ever said
bitter words to him. He was surprised when Athura
sank to her knee, saying, “I have a petition, O King!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>He frowned down upon her, suspecting what she was
about to ask.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he said.</p>

<p>“O brother, the Prince of Iran has begged me to remind
you that our father, Cyrus, promised me to him
in marriage. He requests that you now send me to him
as his wife.”</p>

<p>A smile of disdain curved the heavy lips of the King.
This was the first time his proud sister had ever bent her
knee or presented a petition to him. He gloated a moment
over her in silence, seeking words that might assure
her once for all of the hopelessness of her request.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” he ejaculated. “I come to you with
a message from the gods. His request cannot be
granted now or ever. There is no one fit to mate with
one of our family. Therefore it remains that we, you
and I, you two and I—that we intermarry, so that the
throne of our fathers may continue to be filled with the
race of Cyrus!”</p>

<p>Artistone gasped in astonishment. Athura rose to
her feet, shocked and amazed. Her eyes searched the
evil, leering face of her brother, to ascertain whether he
were crazed or drunk.</p>

<p>“Are you demented?” she gasped. “Marry your
sisters? Never since Aryans lived has it been permitted!
Death will be preferable! Are you in earnest?
Or is it a horrible joke?”</p>

<p>“Never have I been more in earnest, my beautiful
sister!” answered Cambyses, mockingly. “Am I not
King? Is not my decree above all law and custom? I
tell you that presently I will issue my decree making it
lawful for the King of the World to marry even his sister!
I shall marry you, Athura! I will bend your
proud spirit to my will. You, Artistone, shall be my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
wife. You shall be my chief wife, my queen. If either
of you refuse, a bowstring will be your portion. My
other wives shall be subject to you, except as I command.
I have spoken. It shall be so!”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and stalked back towards the
palace, while his sisters stood as if rooted to the earth
staring at his receding form. He turned after going a
dozen paces.</p>

<p>“Write no more messages to that Darius,” he said to
Athura. “I shall send a bowstring to him if you do so.
The world is not large enough to contain him and me at
the same time. I have spoken!”</p>

<p>He continued to the palace, while his sisters, dumb
with amazement and hot with anger, watched his receding
form in silence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE FORCE OF AN OATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Prince of Iran paced slowly back and forth on
the roof of his palace in the citadel of Sardis, in
company with his friend Gobryas. From it, grand
views of famous seas and lands could be had. At one
side, the rugged crests of Mount Tmolus stretched
away in verdant splendor; at the other, and far below,
lay the beautiful plain of Hermus through which flowed
the river Pactolus on its bed of golden sand. Just below,
lay the great city of Sardis, capital of his province,
rich and splendid in its Grecian beauty and Persian
strength. Far away to the west lay the blue waters of
the great sea, with its hundred isles where Grecian
genius had made fairylands of nature’s own gracious
handiwork. Overhead, the softly tinted azure was a
well of golden sunshine. The air was smooth as water
to the face and like nectar to the lungs. But the eyes
of the Prince gazed not on these splendors. They were
moody and introspective.</p>

<p>“Brother of mine,” he was saying, “is not this a land
of infinite pleasure? No wonder these Hellenes cling to
it! No wonder they talk in poems and work out poems
in stone. One could live here very happily, provided
other conditions were assured.”</p>

<p>Gobryas smiled.</p>

<p>“By ‘other conditions,’” he suggested, “you mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
that if a certain Princess who excels all others in the
world in beauty were here, you would be content.”</p>

<p>The Prince nodded a smiling assent.</p>

<p>“Truly you are deep in your reasoning!” he replied.
“Now, while these hills and valleys, this sea and this
plain, may be beautiful, it is not such a paradise for me
as would be the rugged hills of Persia or the hot sands
of Iran, were I permitted to dwell there with that same
Princess. I have often wondered whether, if I were a
simple farmer or a sheep-herder and permitted to have
her with me, I would not be far happier than as a ruler
of this great province without her. Power is sweet to
a man. The right to rule, to speak a word and give life
or death, to sit as a judge righting wrongs and endeavoring
to make the people prosperous and happy, accords
with my disposition. But truly, Gobryas, I would give
all these in exchange for a shepherd’s life with her, the
incomparable queen, the sweetest spirit and most intelligent
mind ever given to inhabit a perfect body. Ah,
God grant that when my letter reached the King through
her, his heart was inclined to justice and to redeem his
father’s pledge to me! But I fear it was not. Else why
this delay? No letter has come from her for weeks,
nor has the King sent me word of his decision. I have
been planning how I would march with ten thousand
men to meet her, even at Damascus.”</p>

<p>“May Ahura-Mazda favor you!” said Gobryas,
heartily. “It may be the King will demand delay on
account of his approaching war with Egypt. It may be
that, instead of a gracious assent to marry, an order
will come for you to lead your fifty thousand veterans
to meet his army at Tyre. Is not your army well appointed
in all its equipment, able to march even to Hamadan
to meet this Princess—perhaps to rescue her? It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
may become necessary. The oath that you and your
father took to Cyrus has bound you to serve an insane
master, who may refuse your just petition.”</p>

<p>“A letter from my father is overdue also,” said the
Prince, ignoring the suggestion of his friend. “How I
would like to see my royal father! Truly he knows the
secret of youth. His years sit lightly upon his shoulders.”</p>

<p>“That is because he has observed the ancient customs
of his people—to live temperately, uprightly, and
energetically.”</p>

<p>“You have said only a part of it. Much is due to
his calmness. He never allows passion or prejudice to
upset his equanimity. He smiles at all terrors, hardships,
or dangers. He accepts that which comes as a
duty. His calm is infinite!”</p>

<p>Their attention was now given to a horseman who
was toiling slowly up the steep side of the mountain to
the citadel. He was dust-covered, and his horse was
wet with sweat.</p>

<p>“A messenger!” exclaimed the Prince. “Now perhaps
we shall hear the decrees of fate! Ah, Gobryas,
you have never known what it is to have the love of
such a woman, and be so in danger of losing her! God
grant that you may some day know the sweetness of
love!”</p>

<p>Gobryas laughed. He twirled the ends of his long
mustache and smoothed down the folds of his cloak.
“While I have never been as deeply in love as you,” he
responded, “yet I know somewhat of it. Has not your
Princess a sister? Perhaps she has smiled on me.”</p>

<p>“What! Artistone? She is a sweet child! Has she
looked upon you with favor?”</p>

<p>“I have thought so,” admitted Gobryas. “I may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
mistaken. She condescended to talk with me sometimes
when we were journeying from Bactra with the
body of her father. Her smiles and her eyes have led
me to believe that she regards me with approval. When
I return from the Egyptian campaign, I shall demand
leave of the King to speak to her of marriage, if you
consent. My family is ancient. I am one of the seven
nobles of Persia from whose daughters the kings have
often chosen their brides.”</p>

<p>“I will leave no influence untried in your favor,” said
the Prince, warmly. “That will be a happy event, if
we who have mingled our blood as brothers, should
marry sisters! How slow that messenger is! His horse
seems to have come far.”</p>

<p>The messenger soon arrived at the citadel wall.
Presently he appeared before the Prince, accompanied by
a servant who carried his dispatch-bag. The Prince
recognized him as one of his father’s messengers, a man
who had followed the King of Iran on many campaigns.</p>

<p>“Hail, royal Prince!” exclaimed the messenger, bending
his knee. “I bring you greetings from your royal
father and letters from him and from Cambyses, the
King of Kings, who was kind enough to entrust me with
a packet for you.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, son of Darya,” said the Prince.
“Go and rest while I read the letters. My servants will
see that you have food and drink. You shall have new
clothing and a bag of gold. After you have been refreshed,
come hither again, as I would question you.”</p>

<p>The servant took the messenger away and gave him of
the best. The Prince hastily broke the seals of the dispatch-bag
and poured out its contents upon a table. He
examined the several packets hastily and was disappointed
at not finding any letter from Athura.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“This is evil luck!” he exclaimed. “Surely she
could have sent me a letter by the hand of this messenger!
Here is an official dispatch bearing the King’s
seal. Here is one from the noble Otanes. Ah, here is
one from my father! We will read it first.”</p>

<p>He broke the seal and unwrapped the vellum which
covered the inner roll of papyrus. Unrolling this, he
read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>Beloved Son</i>:</p>

<p>“It gave me very great pleasure to receive your letter
and to hear that you are well and at peace in your
provinces. A letter from your mother has also arrived
this day. She is well and speaks of her great loneliness
in that both you and I are absent. I have determined to
send for her that she may be with me here, since it now
seems that I shall have to remain here several months.
I have just received a letter from the King of Kings,
by the hand of the Grand Chamberlain, Prexaspes, advising
me that the Prince Bardya has departed for Bactra
from Hamadan. But the Prince has not yet arrived.
This letter also calls for a levy of one hundred thousand
men for the proposed war in Egypt. What Prince
Bardya will say to this request, I fear will not please the
King. Reports have come which cause me much uneasiness.
It is said the King of Kings is consulting the
sorcerers and consorting with those who worship the
Lie. His delay for months to permit Bardya to come
hither has caused much uneasiness.</p>

<p>“This realm is peaceful now, although the Sogdians
are turbulent and the Getæ are ever plotting raids upon
their neighbors. The fear of my veterans is upon them,
however, and the mountain chiefs are making daily professions
of fealty and devotion. But I think it is fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
rather than love which causes them to be at peace and
to turn traders instead of looters.</p>

<p>“But I will write no more, except to say that the son
of Darya will make due inquiries and observations of
affairs at Hamadan so that he may report fully to you
concerning them.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince re-read that portion of the letter referring
to Bardya.</p>

<p>“I look for trouble as soon as Bardya arrives in
Bactra,” said he. “It is well that my father has remained
there. He will restrain the Prince. Now I will
read the King’s letter.”</p>

<p>He took up the largest packet, broke the seal, and
untied the cord around it. The vellum wrappings having
been removed, two clay tablets, written closely in
the cuneiform script of official decrees, were revealed.
He read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I, Cambyses the Achæmenian, son of Cyrus, King
of Kings, King of all the Earth, Ruler of All Nations,
the Great King, have decreed:</p>

<p>“First: That it is lawful for the King of Kings to
take to wife any woman whether it be his sister or another.</p>

<p>“Second: That the Princesses Athura and Artistone
shall be his wives.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince stopped reading. He was speechless with
amazement. He trembled and seemed about to fall; but
Gobryas seized his arm and supported him.</p>

<p>“Am I dreaming? Read it, brother, and say if what
I read is there!” he exclaimed, handing the tablets to
Gobryas.</p>

<p>The latter seized the tablets and looked at them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“There is no mistake!” he said. “So runs the writing!
But God forbid that such act of a maniac could be
accomplished! Will he dare do this thing and the Persian
nobles not tear him from the throne?”</p>

<p>The Prince, with a mighty effort, recovered his
strength and drew up his tall form to its full height, as
he might if facing death. He looked as in a dream at
the distant mountains, at the sparkling sea and the deep
blue of the heavens filled with the soft golden light of
the afternoon sun. His words, when he spoke, were
low and tense:</p>

<p>“This I know, that the Princess Athura will not become
his wife! She may be at this moment dead or in
prison! She would never submit to such infamy! This
is a deadly insult to me, the son of the King of Iran, the
son of kings better in the right to rule than he; and it
shall not be borne! I will march to Hamadan! I will
throw down that cursed beast from the throne! By the
living God, I recall my oath to Cyrus! I am not bound
because he has broken faith. He may have slain her.
He shall die! Come, Gobryas! Not a moment is to be
lost. Gather together my officers. Call into the ranks
every man. We will march before the sun goes down!”</p>

<p>He smote his palms together. His chest heaved
with mighty emotions. The world seemed rocking to its
dissolution and he about to fall with it.</p>

<p>Gobryas placed one arm around his friend and compelled
him to walk slowly back and forth. He feared
for a moment that the Prince’s reason was tottering.
Never had he seen him so moved. He sought for words
to comfort him.</p>

<p>“Beloved Prince,” he said, “listen to me! Athura is
not one who will tamely submit to such wrong. She has
not submitted. She has escaped or she has slain herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
But let us hear further from the messenger. Let
us read these other letters. Then let us take counsel
so that we may not fail. We who have not taken an
oath to Cyrus will pull Cambyses down from his throne
and slay him like a dog! Have good courage, brother!
Let me depart this night for Persia. There I will
gather the lords of Persia and with an army march up
to your aid when you cross the Tigris. Athura and
Artistone may have perished, but vengeance remains.
Let us make Bardya King. Forbid it not! I will depart
this night. Three months from now a hundred
thousand Persians will be camped around the royal palace
at Hamadan.”</p>

<p>The Prince sat down on a bench beneath the awning
and buried his face in his hands. He was silent for
some moments, while Gobryas nervously paced back and
forth. After a while, the Prince again arose, pallid
but calm. He said, speaking argumentatively: “He is
King. My loyalty is to the King, though my hatred is
towards the man. Must we not put aside personal
wrongs, Gobryas, and trust that God will avenge us?
No Achæmenian has ever broken an oath, but has kept
it in spirit as well as in letter. It is hard to serve such a
King, but let us consider well before we start civil war.
If what he has decreed has been accomplished, then am
I absolved from my oath. But I must wait until I know
what has occurred. We will send a dispatch to my
father, seeking his counsel. Shall I plunge the world
into war because of my personal wrong?”</p>

<p>“I had not considered that,” answered Gobryas. “I
am not oath-bound. I dreamed of Artistone; and lo,
this cursed maniac has spoiled my dream! But I shall
be guided by you.”</p>

<p>The Prince went to the table on which the other letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
lay, and took up the one sealed with the seal of
Otanes. He read it aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>To the royal Prince of Iran, son of Hystaspis, the
King, greeting</i>:</p>

<p>“I have intrusted this letter to your servant, knowing
his fidelity, and have instructed him to deliver it to
you alone and not to let it pass from his hands to any
other while he lives. Know that the King has broken
all the ancient laws and customs of Persia; and we, as
one of the seven families of Persia, are calling to the
other six for counsel. We have sent letters to your beloved
father, begging him to consent to reign.</p>

<p>“This Cambyses has proven that he is no longer sane.
He is possessed of devils. His debaucheries have
weakened his mind, while sharpening his appetite for
doing evil. He has advanced the Magi to the choicest
places in the realm. He has failed to remember that
the seven noble families of Persia are entitled to the
chief places under him, as in the time of Cyrus. He is a
worshiper of the Lie and not of the Truth. He has
forgotten the religion of the Aryans and has fallen into
the hands of the fire-worshiping Magi, devil-worshipers
of the hills. He has slain without cause many who
have displeased him, even Persians of high rank. He has
disregarded all laws and customs. The last and most
infamous thing is this marriage with his two sisters
which he purposes to accomplish. He has declared that
he as King is above all laws and customs, that
Aryan laws are not binding on him. Knowing by common
report that you and the royal Princess Athura
are promised to each other, all Persia is in a ferment
of discontent over the gross insult shown you in thus
taking your promised wife by force to his own vile
harem.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Prince Bardya left Hamadan ten months ago for
Bactra. But it is reported that robbers set upon and
captured him just after he left Rhages. He has disappeared.
I think the robbers were the men of Cambyses
and that Bardya has been slain.</p>

<p>“Send us, therefore, but one word, telling us that you
march hither with your army; and we will meet you at
Susa with two hundred thousand men, to throw down
this beast from his throne. In you alone do the Persian
people hope. Your father’s age and inclination may not
permit him to accept the great burden of ruling this empire,
in case Bardya cannot be found; and we shall call
you to the throne. Send us orders.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince was greatly moved. Gobryas watched
him curiously. Would not this letter overcome his
scruples? The Prince sat down heavily by the table and
supported his head on his hands. After a moment of
silence, he said:</p>

<p>“Call the son of Darya.”</p>

<p>Gobryas pulled a silken cord, and immediately a servant
appeared.</p>

<p>“Bring the messenger here,” he commanded.</p>

<p>The son of Darya appeared quickly. He bowed low
before the Prince, who pointed to a bench, indicating
that he might sit. But he remained standing.</p>

<p>“Son of Darya,” said the Prince, “you have come
far and served faithfully. How is the old man, my
father? Has he changed much? Is his body bending
with age and toil?”</p>

<p>The man’s dark eyes glowed with affection as he answered:
“No, royal Master. Your father stoops not,
nor does his face show care. It is not wrinkled save
when he smiles on his sons, as he calls the soldiers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Bactra is happy, because the people dwell in safety and
have justice dealt out to them. Your royal father remains
youthful and is ready to march on smooth or
rough roads at any moment. There is no man in all
Iran like unto him.”</p>

<p>“You saw and heard much as you came hither. You
stopped at Hamadan and you gathered news there for
me. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“I was commanded to see and hear and to report all
to you.”</p>

<p>“It is well. From what you saw and heard, know
you anything concerning the marriage of the King to his
sisters?”</p>

<p>“It was all the talk in the rest-houses and in the
streets of Hamadan when I came to that city. I was
not permitted to see the royal Princesses, as the marriage
feast had occurred but two weeks prior to my
arrival. But I caught a glimpse of the royal lady,
Artistone, at a window in the palace. I thought it was
she. It was said that the King has ten other wives and
keeps them in one part of his palace separate from all
others, like the Assyrians. There had been much murmuring
among the Persians and some rioting between
them and the Magi. I saw the noble Otanes, who was
very wroth and who has since left the city, going southward
to his castle in Persia. He bade me say to you
that you should make quick answer and that he hopes
to hear that your army will march at once to Damascus.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear whether the Princesses consented?”</p>

<p>“They both refused to consent to the marriage; but
the King decreed the marriage instead of observing the
Persian custom of marrying. It was reported that he
gave them their choice of marriage or death, and that
Princess Athura chose death. It was also reported that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
one of the Princesses had escaped from the palace and
had disappeared. I know that squads of cavalry were
searching the country all around the city. It was said
to be Athura who fled. I have also a verbal message
from Prexaspes, who bade me say to you these words,
‘The bird has escaped the fowler’s net.’”</p>

<p>“What else said he?” demanded the Prince, greatly
agitated.</p>

<p>“Nothing. But he gave me a purse of gold.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard whether Athura was found?”</p>

<p>“No. The palace servants are quaking with terror
and dare not talk. It is said that the King slew three of
them with his own hands on the day when the Princess
fled. She had not been discovered, I think, when I
left.”</p>

<p>“What heard you of the Prince Bardya?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that he had departed from the city
some months before I arrived, going towards Rhages.
At Rhages, it was said that the Prince had passed
through and had then been set upon by robbers and
taken into the mountains. It is a great mystery. Some
say that he is dead, slain by the Magi, or that the Magi
have him imprisoned in their mountain strongholds.”</p>

<p>“What rumors of the war with Egypt did you hear?”</p>

<p>“The King is gathering a great army from all parts
of his empire. It is said he will gather it at Arbela in
the spring and march thence by way of Damascus and
Tyre.”</p>

<p>“You heard nothing more of the Princesses?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I spoke with the guards of the palace.
But they are black-faced villains from Azerbijan, under
the control of the Magi; and they would tell me nothing.”</p>

<p>“You may go now,” said the Prince. “You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
done well. Go and rest. I will call you again. Make
ready to return in three days.”</p>

<p>The man departed.</p>

<p>“What mean the words of Prexaspes, think you?”
asked the Prince, turning to Gobryas. “Does he refer
to Bardya or to Athura?”</p>

<p>“I should say, to Athura. Prexaspes loved not
Bardya, but he admired you. Undoubtedly he referred
to Athura. Perhaps the packet containing the King’s
decrees contained a letter from him.”</p>

<p>Gobryas took the wrappers up from the floor where
they had fallen and found a closely written sheet of
vellum.</p>

<p>“It is a letter from Prexaspes,” he said.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>To the Prince of Iran, greeting</i>:</p>

<p>“Cambyses, King of Kings, the King of All the
Earth, the Great King, commands that you gather fifty
thousand soldiers and, leaving only force sufficient to
garrison the chief cities under command of Metaphernes,
that you march to Tyre, there to await the gathering of
the other armies of the King. He has determined to
punish the King of Egypt for injuries and insults heretofore
sustained. You are ordered to hire all the Phœnician
ships and as many of the Hellenes as you can.
Let them also gather at Tyre. Also to engage all the
Cretan slingers and Greek hoplites from Ionia and the
islands. Pay them liberally from the King’s money.
Bring with you the treasures of your provinces and
gather provisions at Tyre to subsist five hundred thousand
men for a year’s campaign in Egypt. Be ready to
lead the King’s armies. For the King orders that you
have chief command under him. In four months be at
the place appointed.</p>

<p class="right">“(For the King) <span class="smcap">Prexaspes</span>.”</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“The King does me honor indeed!” exclaimed the
Prince, angrily. “One day he insults and wrongs me;
the next he appoints me leader of his army. I will
march to Tyre, indeed! If I march no further towards
Hamadan, it will be because I find that Athura has indeed
escaped. But, alas! Gobryas, I fear much that
she escaped only by the aid of a dagger.”</p>

<p>“Better the dagger than the fate of Artistone! Did
the messenger not say he saw her at a palace window
two weeks after the marriage? She is but a child, and
could not escape! O, my Prince and brother! Give
me leave this night to start for Persia! I do not ask
you to raise your hand against the King! But I will
stir up all Persia against him. May Ahriman seize
him!”</p>

<p>Gobryas paced back and forth, greatly agitated. But
the Prince shook his head.</p>

<p>“Let us not be hasty, dear brother!” he said. “In
my own grief I had forgotten that you love Artistone.
Whatever has been done cannot now be undone. Vengeance
will wait and be more sure to those who make
sufficient preparation. Let us hasten our departure.
Perhaps Athura is flying hither, and we must prepare to
receive and protect her. If it means war, let it come!
I cannot throw Cambyses down from his throne; but my
oath does not prohibit me from resisting his tyranny by
force. I cannot agree with Otanes to make war on him.
Nor can I permit you, my brother, to go into Persia to
aid in a conspiracy against him. He has wronged you
unwittingly and has put no insult upon you, as he has
upon me. Nevertheless, if Athura has escaped and
claims my protection, she shall have it even if war be
the result.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>A CLASH OF WILLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ATHURA and Artistone, sisters of the Great King,
were alone in their magnificent sitting-room in the
palace, having dismissed all their attendants. They sat
on a velvet-covered couch with heads close together,
discussing the latest action of the King. Between
them lay a tablet on which was engraved a copy
of the King’s decree, declaring the new law, that the
King of Kings might marry his sisters. Some days had
elapsed since the King of Kings had told them of his
intention, but as he had not again spoken on the subject,
they had concluded that he was jesting. This decree
indicated his set purpose.</p>

<p>“Is the decree law?” asked Artistone.</p>

<p>“No, it is not law! The King cannot set aside the
customs of his people by decrees,” answered Athura.
“I am sure that the Kings of Iran in all ages have been
bound by law and custom. But in this new empire,
it may be that the King’s decree is law, since there is
none to gainsay it. This decree shall never bind me!
Death will be welcome rather than submission to this
brutal decree!”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“I have my dagger! I shall slay Cambyses, or myself,
should he seek to force us into marriage with him.”</p>

<p>Artistone sighed. Her wan countenance indicated
fear. She was only a child of fifteen years. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Athura lacked neither courage nor decision. The spirit
of her father blazed within her.</p>

<p>“Let us plan escape,” she said. “This night we will
leave the palace. We will disguise ourselves in men’s
clothing and we will fly to Persia for safety. The lords
of Persia will protect us. We cannot escape to Bactra.
There is but one road and that will be watched.”</p>

<p>“How can I travel so?” her sister rejoined, tears
flowing down her cheeks. “I am not strong like you.
But I will follow you.”</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the noise of
heavy footsteps in the hall without. The heavy curtains
at the door were pushed aside and the King himself
appeared. He stopped just within the threshold and,
folding his arms, struck a majestic attitude and looked
down at his sisters.</p>

<p>He writhed his brutal countenance into the semblance
of a smile and said: “All hail, great Queens, wives of
the King of Kings, the Great King! Are you not rejoicing
that I have condescended to do you so great
honor as to make you both the first ladies in all the
world?”</p>

<p>The sisters were speechless. They gazed up at the
harsh features of their brother, as if upon a serpent.</p>

<p>As they did not answer, he continued: “I never did
like the formalities of a state marriage. My decree was
the shortest and best way, since it did not require
your assent. I come now to ask you to set a near date
for the marriage feast. At the end of the week, you
shall be crowned Queens of the Earth. What say you?”</p>

<p>He ceased and waited for an answer, leering at them
drunkenly.</p>

<p>“Surely you mean not to make us actually wives,
contrary to all the laws of the Medes and Persians?”
said Athura.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“But it is not contrary to their laws,” he retorted.
“Have I not decreed a new law? Am I not supreme?
Is there any other that can make a law? Ah, you are
a proud woman, Athura, and your heart is set on that
Prince of Iran whom I hate above all men and would
slay, were it not greater satisfaction to make him serve
me without his hoped-for reward of marrying you! I
have thought well on this noble revenge! I hate you
also; but I will bend you to my will, and you shall be my
concubine if not my wife, whether you desire or not!
As for Artistone, I hate her not. I prefer to make her
my chief wife. She shall be Queen. I have spoken!
Artistone, go to the Queen’s room and there abide.
Athura, follow me now to the room set apart for my
women!”</p>

<p>Athura rose, her eyes blazing, and moved swiftly towards
the King, with her right hand drawing from her
bodice a short, keen dagger.</p>

<p>“Truly, brute without sense or reason,” she hissed,
“I come to you, but with death in my hand!”</p>

<p>She leaped towards him and the dagger gleamed in
her raised hand. With an exclamation of alarm the
King sprang backward through the door. He stumbled
and almost fell as he ran down the hall. As she did
not pursue, he halted and shouted at her, while shaking
his fist: “Death is it? So shall it be to you, after I
bend your proud spirit!” Then he roared for his
guards.</p>

<p>Athura paused at the door. She heard the King’s
threat and his wrathful call for his body-guard. She
saw the hall filling with armed men. She turned back
and fled across the room, crying to her sister: “Come!
Follow me into the bedroom! They come to seize us!”</p>

<p>But Artistone, as if dazed, sat still, and, weeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
aloud, wrung her hands. Athura paused at the door of
her bedroom and cried: “Come! Hurry!”</p>

<p>A dozen men poured into the room and rushed towards
her. Artistone did not move. Athura entered
her room, threw shut the heavy door, and bolted it just
as the men hurled themselves against it. The King
shouted in a loud voice so that Athura might hear:
“Let her stay there and starve awhile! She will come
to her senses! Establish guards here and watch! Let
her not escape on forfeit of your lives! She will kiss
my hand presently. As for you, Artistone, come with
me. You shall be my Queen!” He went to Artistone,
took her by the hand, and led her, weeping bitterly,
away. The sisters never saw each other again.</p>

<p>Athura waited like a tigress at bay, dagger in hand,
at her bedroom door, until satisfied that no attempt
would be made to force an entrance. Then she examined
the brazen lattice-work with which a window
looking out upon the inner court was guarded and saw
that it was securely fastened. She drew a heavy curtain
over the window. Thus securely shut in she began to
prepare for escape. She realized that she was powerless
to aid her sister. It was equally clear to her that only in
immediate escape could she avoid disgrace or death.
It would be useless to ask mercy of the King. Her plan
of escape was already formed. She was acquainted
with every room and passage in the palace, and knew
the secrets of it. Her only fear was that Cambyses
also knew those secrets and would set guards to watch
every avenue of escape.</p>

<p>After assuring herself that no immediate attempt
would be made to break into her retreat, she entered a
large closet, which was connected with her room by a
door and in which were stored her clothing and jewels.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
It was a long, narrow room. At one end was a window
guarded by brazen lattice-work and by shutters of the
same metal. The shutter was hinged to the sills and
commonly stood open to admit air into the closet. The
lattice-work was also hung on hinges but was secured
by a massive lock on the inside. Athura took a key
from a convenient hook, cautiously inserted it into the
lock in the lattice, and found that it would readily turn.
She looked out across the roof of a lower portion of the
palace into the park at the western side and saw no
guards. Satisfied that the way was yet clear, she
quickly opened a chest at one corner of the closet and
took from it a short ladder of rope, a suit of clothes of
a sort commonly worn by young men, and a jeweled
belt from which hung a short sword. It had been years
since she had used these. She sighed as she remembered
how she and her brother Bardya, without the knowledge
of the Great King, her father, had sometimes disguised
themselves and wandered forth at night to observe the
common people, to take part in their sports and entertainments,
and to mingle with those who came and went
on the streets of the city. How long ago that seemed!
As she knelt by the chest and laid out the clothes, she
recalled how the Prince of Iran, having been admitted
to the secrets of her escapades, had gravely rebuked her,
but had nevertheless disguised himself and accompanied
her and Bardya, as he said, to protect them. The danger
of her situation allowed her to think but a moment of
those happy days. From another chest, bound with
silver bands, she took a long necklace of precious stones,
and a belt of beautifully embossed leather to which were
fastened purselike compartments full of gold coins.
She undressed and fastened the money-belt around her
waist. Then she put on the suit of men’s clothing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
stowed away the jewels in its pockets. She then cut her
hair to a length just sufficient to touch the collar of her
tunic. Upon her head she set a round felt cap. Critically
surveying her appearance in a mirror, she saw that
she resembled a well-dressed youth of the nobler class
of Medes, but one whose face was far too beautiful and
feminine to pass for that of a man. Taking from a
cabinet a box of unguents and powders, she skillfully
deepened the color of her eyebrows and darkened her
complexion, until she resembled a young Mede of mixed
Semitic and Aryan blood.</p>

<p>These preparations consumed much time. Darkness
fell upon the earth. Then a heavy knocking sounded
upon the door of the bedroom and a rough voice said:
“May you live forever, O Great Princess! I have a
message from my royal Master, the King of Kings!”</p>

<p>She made no answer and, after a moment, the voice
continued: “Once more does the King of Kings offer
you peace and a place of honor as his wife. Otherwise
his sentence is that you have neither food nor water
until you submit to his royal will.”</p>

<p>Then Athura answered, “Tell your Lord and Master
that I will take until the morning to consider.”</p>

<p>“I am your slave!” responded the voice.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” exclaimed the King, when he received
Athura’s message. “Our proud-spirited sister may submit,
since she sends me back so mild an answer. It is
well! The word of the King must prevail. A day or
two of solitude will not harm her. We shall yet be a
happy family!”</p>

<p>He laughed loud and long and drank deeply of soma.
Artistone, who sat with him at dinner, made no answer,
but her eyes, red with weeping, gave evidence of her
woe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>As soon as darkness came fully over the palace,
Athura went forth cautiously upon the roof of the
portico, descended to the ground by means of her rope
ladder, and stole away through the gloom among the
trees and shrubbery in the park. Knowing every path,
every bush and tree, it was not difficult for her to find
a way and to avoid the points where the guards sauntered
listlessly to and fro, keeping careless ward. The
King had not remembered her avenue of escape, or the
guards were careless. She climbed over the stone walls
surrounding the park, with the aid of her rope ladder,
and, making a détour to avoid the guards, walked rapidly
and boldly into the city. She went straight to a horse-market
and roused a sleepy servant, who, though at first
disposed to grumble at so late a visitor, speedily turned
obsequious when a coin was pressed into his hand. He
forthwith brought out one of the dealers in horses.</p>

<p>“A pretty time to come buying horses!” grumbled
the latter, yawning and stretching his limbs. “Think
you, my young sprig, that I work day and night?”</p>

<p>“Peace, grumbler!” retorted Athura, speaking
hoarsely. “If I come to buy a Nicæan steed by lamplight,
what is that to you, seeing that I have the coin?
I must go on a journey to-night many miles to the
northward and need to hire a horse. But lest you deem
me a robber, I will deposit the full price of the animal,
to be returned when I return the horse. One condition
only I exact—he must have speed and go comfortably
without fright or stumble. Fool me in this and I will
bring down the wrath of a mighty man upon you! Have
you a good horse?”</p>

<p>“Have I a good horse? I keep nothing else, young
sir! Come to the stalls!”</p>

<p>He led the way with alacrity. He pointed to a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
animal, saying, “This one is good in bottom and long
in legs. He will carry your insignificant weight all night.
Here is a Nicæan steed; but he is a fierce animal and
will not brook punishment of whip or spur. Speak
gently to him and he will carry you a week without
rest. But he surely is beyond your price!”</p>

<p>“What is his price? I doubt that he has such mettle
as you think.”</p>

<p>“Fifty Lydian staters is his price. For riding him
this night the price will be one Lydian stater, if you
return him to me to-morrow without injury. Assuredly
you may have a cheaper horse than this!”</p>

<p>“Extortioner! Twenty staters is more than a good
price for that animal. I will surely report you to the
governor of the market. Think you I know nothing of
horses?”</p>

<p>The dealer spread out his hands and bowed as if in
deep humility, saying: “I perceive your worship is well
acquainted with horseflesh. Come, I will not haggle
with you. Deposit your twenty staters in my hand and
take him. But you will surely pay an additional stater
for a fine saddle!”</p>

<p>“Verily you are an extortioner! But I will not haggle.
One half-stater and no more! Make haste, since
my lady-love will not wait for my coming too long!”</p>

<p>Athura took a handful of coins from a purse at her
belt and counted it into the outstretched palm of the
greedy dealer, whose eyes sparkled in triumph. The
amount was a third more than the animal was worth.
The horse was brought out, saddled and bridled, champing
his bits and pawing the earth, impatient to be gone.
Athura loved a good horse. She was an accomplished
rider. She sprang lightly into the saddle and trotted
away, shouting back at the dealer: “Farewell, son of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Ahriman! Keep the gold should I not return. I may
go on to Rhages before I come back.”</p>

<p>The dealer waved his hand in reply and said to his
servant: “Young sprig! Thought he knew the prices
of animals! Bah! But then, he has a good horse, even
if he paid a stiff price. Who can he be? May the dogs
bite him if he try to return that animal! See that you
be ready to testify that this was a sale and not a letting.
We shall not repurchase the horse.”</p>

<p>“Yea, verily, Master, it was a sale,” answered the
servant. Then they retired to their couches well satisfied.</p>

<p>Athura cantered rapidly along the principal street of
the city going north. Night watchmen threw upon her
the rays of their lanterns. She passed a squad of soldiers
in front of a public house, where, under the influence
of wine, they were singing and making merry.
To their gibes, she waved her hand, but declined their
invitation to alight and join them. She came to the
outer boundaries of the city on the road to Rhages.
There the guards sat carelessly playing dice in their
shelter at the roadside. They heard the rapid hoof-beats
of a horse approaching from the city, but before
they could come forth to challenge, the horse with its
rider flashed by at full speed. In a second, the twain disappeared
in a cloud of dust and darkness. Grumbling
that their ease should be thus broken, the guards returned
to their game. Had they known who had passed
and that on the morrow they would be flayed alive and
quartered by an infuriated King, they would not have
been so careless. This was not their first omission of
duty, but it was the first in which the King was directly
concerned; and it was their last. They met their fate
at sundown on the morrow in the market-place after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
a short interrogation by the King himself, as an exhibition
to all men of the King’s justice upon those who
neglected duty.</p>

<p>It must be said of Cambyses that although to his own
passions and desires he gave loose rein and was brutal
to those who interfered therewith, yet to his subjects he
was just, and was strict in the enforcement of law. Because
he regarded himself as the lawgiver, he regarded
a breach of the law as an insult to himself. He caused
one corrupt judge to be flayed alive in the market-place.
Other evil-doers were maimed or strangled. Not only
did the guards of the road whose orders compelled them
to exact a pass of any one passing in or out of the city
after nightfall suffer, but several palace-guards whose
duty it was to watch the palace walls, were strangled
with the bowstring. His fury even threatened Prexaspes,
but that astute official was able to prove that he had
gone on a mission to a neighboring city and could not be
involved in Athura’s sudden disappearance. Spies soon
learned of the flight of the steed and its rider on the
northern road. They found the horse-dealer, whose
description of the rider indicated that it was Athura in
disguise who had hired the horse. Bands of troopers
were sent out on every road and into the fields and
mountains around the city. None knew except the captains
in charge of the bands for whom the search was
being made. It was reported generally that a robber
had broken into the palace and carried away some of
the King’s jewels.</p>

<p>Athura rode northward for half an hour, then turning
sharply to the right and following a road which was
little better than a path, but which led to one of the
King’s desert gardens, she came to a well-beaten caravan-route
leading southward towards what is now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
city of Isfahan. Taking this road, she followed it southward
until she entered a road branching southwestward to
Adrapan, the winter palace of Cyrus. By this circuitous
way she hoped to deceive those who might pursue into
the belief that she was fleeing to Bactra by way of
Rhages. She did not dare take the road to Persia direct,
but planned to ride by way of Susa, or, perhaps, if her
intention should change upon reflection, she would flee
to Damascus and thence to her Prince at Sardis. As
she rode, her active brain elaborated her plans.</p>

<p>The night was cool and clear. The brilliant stars
scintillated in the autumn sky. A quarter-moon gave
down a subdued light. A breeze swept down from
Mount Elwend, whose rugged heights lay darkly against
the western sky. The road to Adrapan followed the
base of a promontory of the Zagros range, which here
jutted out into the plain. Here and there near the
highway were the cottages of gardeners, who by irrigating
their crops with the precious waters of Elwend,
caused the fertile soil to yield the vegetable supply for
the capital city. The odor of flowers and fruits permeated
the air. The strong, spirited horse, glorying in
his strength and scarce feeling the weight of his rider,
galloped onward with long, even strides. No one interrupted
their progress. The cottagers, if partially
aroused by the rapid beat of hoofs and the barking of
dogs, sleepily muttered, “A King’s messenger!” turned
over on their pallets, and again slumbered.</p>

<p>Adrapan lay on the southern slopes of Mount Elwend.
Here the snows, which annually fell over Hamadan, seldom
came; and, if they did, the southern exposure to
the sun caused them quickly to melt away. To the right
of the highway which passed westward through the
village was the palace, in a great park of noble trees.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
On the left were several houses occupied by those who
made their livelihood trading with the thousands of
nobles and retainers who honored the King as his guests
or served him as retainers. Here caravans from Damascus
and the west coming by way of Nineveh, or from the
south, coming by way of Babylon and Susa, stopped to
enjoy the salubrious climate and recuperate after enduring
the hot districts along the Tigris and the difficult
roads across the Zagros Mountains. At this time the
palace and its park were in the care of keepers and
Adrapan was deserted, save by inn-keepers and traders.</p>

<p>Athura sighed as she came in sight of the village.
She remembered the pleasant days when, a child, she
had wandered in the park with her father, or played
there with Bardya and the young Prince of Iran. How
long ago those days seemed! Her noble, erect, keen-eyed,
kind-hearted, and loving father; her joyous, laughter-loving,
and boisterous brother; and the tall youth,
whose calm demeanor, royal bearing, and worshipful
eyes were ever in her mind—all appeared in her memory.
Tears came into her eyes, and her lips trembled
with emotion. She brought her panting steed to a stop
within the deep shadows of the trees and halted a moment
to consider her course. If she should pass through
the village, she might be seen and accosted. If she
should enter the park, she would incur danger from wild
beasts which sometimes came down from the mountains.
Bears, wolves, a leopard, a tiger, and even a lion had
been seen in the park. She knew all the paths through
the woodland and that, by going a roundabout way, she
might avoid the palace and the village, but it would lead
through wild, dark places. Though she had fear of wild
beasts, she feared more to be overtaken by the pursuers
that her brother might send after her. She decided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
follow the dark paths of the forest and defy the dangers
from wild beasts. Turning her horse, she plunged
boldly into the woodland.</p>

<p>The turf deadened the hoof-beats of the horse. No
sound was heard save the cry of an owl, the song of a
bulbul, and the chirp of insects. Gathering the bridle
reins in one hand, she drew the short sword from its
sheath at her belt with the other and carried it ready to
meet any danger that might assail her. Once she raised
the sword high towards heaven and prayed in a whisper,
“Thou, Ahura-Mazda, Good Spirit and Protector, send
Sraosha, victorious leader of the hosts of heaven, to
guard me from Angro-mainyus and the Devas!”</p>

<p>She went slowly and warily. A dim light from the
declining moon and the stars enabled her to recognize the
pathways. Her horse, tossing his noble head and pricking
forward his slender ears, followed the paths with
certain step, unafraid of the sounds of the night. If a
bear or wolf, sniffing the breeze on the heights above,
became aware of their presence, it did not descend to
investigate, nor did any leopard, tiger, or lion molest
her. For an hour she slowly followed the devious ways,
but at length returned to the highway a parasang west of
the village. That she had acted wisely appeared on the
following day, when a squad of the King’s horsemen
rode into Adrapan and made inquiry. The villagers and
the palace watchmen swore that no one had passed
through during the preceding night, although careful
vigil had been maintained on account of a report that
a band of robbers had been seen in the neighboring
mountains.</p>

<p>On the highway again, horse and rider, somewhat
rested by the leisurely progress through the woodland,
sped away westward at a gallop. The highway was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
smooth for several miles, until it plunged into the defiles
of the Zagros Mountains, through which flowed the
headwater streams of the river Choaspes. Then it became
more difficult, with steep grades, crossing on stone
bridges over deep gorges, the beds of roaring streams,
and winding about steep bluffs and over sharp ridges.
Morning found the fugitive many miles from Hamadan
in the midst of mountains; and her weariness and that of
her steed warned her that she must find a resting-place.
Twice she fruitlessly turned from the road to follow
paths leading up narrow canyons, hoping to find a suitable
hiding-place. The third time she followed a narrow
pass leading into a small valley and there found a
sheepfold and a shepherd’s cabin. The shepherd and his
flock were in the hills, where the warm rays of the sun
and the waters of many springs kept the grass sweet and
tender.</p>

<p>Finding the hut empty and no one near, Athura descended
stiffly from her horse and searched for food.
She found a large jar of barley in the hut and gave her
horse a generous feed from it. Then, having tied him
to a tree, she searched the cabin for food that she might
eat. The long ride had made her tired and faint.
Hunger reminded her that she had eaten nothing since
the previous noon. She opened cupboards and chests
and presently found a box in which the shepherd had
left a piece of roasted mutton and some round flat cakes
of bread, made of coarse barley flour. The fare satisfied
her hunger. Then she shut and barred the stout
cabin-door and threw herself upon a bundle of sheep-skins
which lay on the floor, and slept several hours.
When the day was half gone, after another hasty meal
she went on her way.</p>

<p>The shepherd did not return till the shades of night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
were falling. His surprise and indignation were great
when he found that some one had entered his cabin,
eaten his bread and meat, and taken some of his grain;
but he was delighted when he found lying in the bread-box
a gold piece. He tried the coin with his teeth and
excitedly turned it over and over in his palm. Then
he hid it safely in the earth at one corner of his hut.</p>

<p>“Truly,” he muttered, “some god must have rested
here, or a spirit of the hills! But no, they would not
eat my food. May luck go with this patron of mine
forever!”</p>

<p>It was after noon when Athura left the shepherd’s
hut and rode out of the canyon to the highway. She
turned her face westward and rode as rapidly as the
steep grades and dangerous passes would permit, anxiously
scanning every reach ahead lest she meet a caravan,
an inquisitive traveler, or a band of robbers. Outlaws
frequently attacked caravans in those days and places,
as they do yet. Travel except with guards or in large
companies was dangerous. Once as she rode past the
mouth of a canyon she observed several men sitting
around a camp-fire a hundred paces from the road.
When they observed her, they shouted and ran to their
horses, which were grazing near by them. She spoke
to her horse and urged him to greater speed. He responded
nobly. The hiss of an arrow passed over her
head. Her horse, as if realizing the need of haste, fled
with frightful speed. Once she looked back and saw
the pursuers; but, as they were mounted on small mountain
ponies, they were soon left far behind and gave
over the pursuit.</p>

<p>With an occasional halt at the crest of ridges over
which the road passed, the fugitive pressed onward till
night fell. After stopping a short time to allow the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
horse to graze and rest, she continued the flight during
the night hours. The brawling river along whose course
the way led filled the canyons with its murmur. The
cry of night birds and the howl of wolves sounded dismally
from the heights. Once her horse snorted and
sprang away at a rapid pace from the shadow of a
clump of bushes. At another time he shook his head
and dashed madly at several dark, slinking forms in the
road; these leaped aside from his charge, snarling and
chattering. It required all her will to restrain the fear
of unknown and unseen dangers of the darkness and
hills which gripped at her heart. She allowed her intelligent
horse to pick his own way, and he did not fail her.</p>

<p>At midnight she emerged from the mountain gorges
and entered the little plain of Bagistan, where she halted
at the base of the celebrated rock of Behistun. She
recognized this great rock, on which was engraved in
huge letters the legend of Semiramis. As she looked up
at its bold, jagged skyline, she wondered whether the
time would ever come when she, like Semiramis, might
stand there the queen of the world. Years afterwards
she did stand there as queen of the world and watched
the workmen of her husband erase the story of Semiramis
and carve thereon a short history of his own exploits.
She dismounted and, standing by the side of her
horse, leaned wearily against him and meditated what
road to take. For here was a parting of the ways. To
her right, the road led to Nineveh, Damascus, and Sardis,
where she might find her Prince; to the left lay the
road to Susa and Persepolis. Should she go to the
Prince of Iran and thus plunge him into war with Cambyses,
or should she seek the protection of the lords of
Persia? It was a grave question, hard to solve, and she
almost wept because of her own indecision.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“All hail and live forever, Princess Athura! Be not
afraid!” A voice came to her out of the darkness near
the great rock.</p>

<p>Gasping with dismay, she sprang into the saddle and
was about to flee.</p>

<p>“Be not afraid!” said the voice again, and the tone
was strangely familiar and reassuring.</p>

<p>“Who speaks?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Your servant, Belteshazzer, the Hebrew, gracious
lady!”</p>

<p>The voice recalled the days when she sat at the feet
of the great teacher and listened to his wisdom.</p>

<p>“It must indeed be Belteshazzer!” she exclaimed,
with a sigh of relief. “None else could know me!
Now Ahura-Mazda be praised! How come you here?”</p>

<p>A tall form emerged from the darker shadows and
drew near. “I came up from Susa in obedience to the
command of a spirit,” he said. “I knew not why I was
urged to come until I reached the shadow of this great
rock. Then I knew that I was sent to meet you here.
In the spirit I saw you coming. Do you remember the
lessons in the west tower of the palace at Hamadan, and
how the Hebrew was not easy for you to learn?”</p>

<p>She remembered well this wonderful man, whose wisdom
was that of a god, whose eyes read the very
thoughts of men, and whose heart was pure and kind.
With a happy note in her voice she answered: “Truly,
Master, I am that unapt scholar in Hebrew! What joy
to meet you here! Truly God has guided you hither!
Now I may call upon your great wisdom to advise me
what to do. Approach nearer, I pray you!”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer advanced to the side of the horse and,
bending over the fair hand she extended to him, touched
it with his forehead in reverence and affection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“I hold it great happiness to be of service to you,”
he said. “In the village near by is my caravan. I have
there a new tent with new furniture never used by any
other. It is at your service. There await your service
also two handmaidens of my own race, daughters of a
prince of my family, discreet and worthy of trust. I
have also many servants, all well-armed. My caravan
is large. Come and dwell with us until the years of
Cambyses shall be fulfilled. I know from what you have
fled. You shall be a princess of my people until these
troublous days are over. O Most Beloved of the Nations,
you may abide in my care until the time when your
Prince shall come to the throne! If you tire of the tent-life
with the caravan, my palace in Shushan, or my house
in Babylon, shall be yours.”</p>

<p>“Is it best that I do not go to the Prince now?”</p>

<p>“It is best that you do not. It would mean instant
war between him and Cambyses. The times are not
right for that. Neither should you go to the lords of
Persia. For Cambyses has already sent armed men out
on all the roads leading to Persepolis. Even now couriers
are not far behind you going to Susa with orders
to watch for and intercept you.”</p>

<p>“I will be guided by you, O Prophet of God! Lead
the way and I will follow.”</p>

<p>He led the way towards the village of Bagistan in the
valley below, and soon came to his caravan. He conducted
her to a beautiful tent furnished with all the
luxuries of tent-life. Two beautiful maidens were
brought to her.</p>

<p>“My children,” said Belteshazzer to them, “behold
your mistress. She is one of the great ones of earth
and is worthy of all service. She shall be known to you
as the Princess Esther. It is enough for you to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
that she is one most highly favored of our God. You
must obey her slightest wish. Your training in the house
of Belteshazzer has fitted you to serve the greatest of
earth. Let your tongues never speak unto others what
you may see or hear concerning her. To all questions
say that she is a relative of Belteshazzer. For are we
not all descended from one common Father?”</p>

<p>They fell on their knees before Athura, the strange,
beautiful one, whose face was that of a woman though
her garb was that of a man. Each, taking one of
Athura’s hands, placed it upon her head, saying in the
soft accents of the Syrian tongue: “We shall heed
your words, great Master. We are her servants.”</p>

<p>Athura smiled upon the maidens and raising them up
impulsively kissed them, saying in the same language,
with which she was familiar: “Your service will be
light. You shall be my sisters and companions rather
than servants. The princesses of the house of Belteshazzer
are worthy to be friends of the highest born.”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer then retired. From chests full of rich
garments, the maids quickly produced feminine apparel
and at once proceeded to bathe, dress, and perfume their
new mistress. Presently, under their ministrations,
Athura in all her matchless beauty and royal demeanor
stood before them like Deborah of old, a veritable
Hebrew princess.</p>

<p>Belteshazzer traveled into Arabia, and the Princess
Esther went with him. No one imagined that the beautiful
young woman, to whom all naturally gave deference,
was the first Princess of the Empire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>THE WAR AGAINST EGYPT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Great King continued to prepare for war with
the Egyptians. There came to him a Greek
named Phanes, who at one time had been high in the
service of King Amasis of Egypt, but who, having conspired
against him, was compelled to flee. By flattery
and art he raised himself high in the estimation of
Cambyses and inflamed his mind with tales of the wealth
that would be found in the great temples of the Nile
Valley. The King then hastened his preparations and
sent him to raise levies amongst the Ionian Greeks.
The Greeks who remained in the service of the Egyptian
King so hated him because of his treachery that
they had made a blood covenant to kill him. But he
succeeded in recruiting a large body of his countrymen,
who marched with him and the Prince of Iran towards
Tyre.</p>

<p>When spring opened, the vast array of men whom the
King had gathered from Iran, Assyria, and Babylonia,
marched by way of Damascus towards Tyre. Many
nations contributed troops. Wild mountaineers of the
Caucasus marched shoulder to shoulder with the
polished, slighter-built Babylonians. The light-armed
Getæ and Derbicæ rode with the heavy cavalry of the
Medes and Persians. From Bactra and Sogdiana came
a portion of the veteran army of King Hystaspis.
From the Zagros and Elburz mountains poured out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
fierce infantry of Aryan blood. Chariots, hundreds in
number, rumbled over the rough desert roads. Bowmen,
spearmen, slingers, and swordsmen, a half million
or more in all, rolled like a tide across the wastes.
The army under the Prince of Iran was composed for
the most part of veterans of many wars, inured to army
life and eager to follow their Prince to battle. Its
nucleus was the old Imperial Guard of Cyrus, recruited
to its full number of thirty thousand horsemen. The
remainder were fighters from the warlike peoples of his
satrapy—Lydians, Greeks, Scythians of the Black Sea
regions, Paphlagonians, Hebrews, and Syrians.</p>

<p>It was springtime when the Great King, leaving
Patatheites, the Magian, as regent of the empire, departed
from his capital of Hamadan, accompanied by his
sister-wife, Artistone, and a portion of his harem. A
thousand servants marched with him to administer to
his comfort. He journeyed by easy stages to Damascus
and thence to Tyre.</p>

<p>The city of Tyre, though nominally independent, had
been coerced into lending her fleets to the King of Kings.
Though it occupied a strong position on an island and
though its people carried on a great trade with Egypt,
yet when the veteran army of the Prince of Iran encamped
on the mainland opposite, and his demand came
in the name of the Great King that it should furnish a
fleet of vessels for his use, it hastened to comply.</p>

<p>During the weeks that had passed since he had received
a copy of the decree of the King concerning the
marriage of Cambyses to his sisters, the Prince had
visibly aged. He had become taciturn and stern. A
smile seldom appeared upon his countenance. His
officers, who had known him for years, sympathized
with him but grumbled at his obstinacy in not declaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
war against Cambyses. They were ready for revolt.
Gobryas especially was discontented. He was bitter
towards the King because of the wreck of his hopes of
winning Artistone. He reported to the Prince the spirit
of revolt that pervaded the army and urged him repeatedly
to act; but the latter requested him to wait.</p>

<p>When the Persian and Bactrian troops arrived,
having outmarched the King, who lingered at Damascus,
their leaders came to the Prince and offered their
services, if he would but consent to seize the government.
Letters arrived from Otanes, urging him to
seize Cambyses. To all he said, “Wait!” Couriers
came from his father counseling prudence and loyalty,
at least until it should certainly appear that the King
held Athura against her will. A mighty struggle went
on within him. Oath-bound loyalty to the King could
scarce restrain the wrath that fired his soul to action
against the hated tyrant.</p>

<p>When the couriers arrived from Damascus saying
that the King was about to leave that city, the Prince
called them aside and inquired of them if they knew
whether the King was bringing his sisters with him.
They reported that he had with him Artistone, whom
he presented to all as his Queen; but as for Athura no
one knew where she was, though it was currently reported
that he had imprisoned her in his harem at
Hamadan. His own couriers and spies returned from
Hamadan without other information than rumors, some
of which indicated that Athura was dead, others that
she had escaped to Persia, and others that she was imprisoned
in the King’s harem.</p>

<p>While he was in this state of indecision, resolved one
day to raise the standard of revolt and march against
Cambyses, and the next to remain loyal, at least till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
he should know the truth concerning Athura’s fate,
Prexaspes, attended by a company of Medean cavalry,
rode into camp and requested an interview. The Prince
received him without delay, and alone in his tent. The
wily Mede, after due salutation, went straight to the
subject of his mission.</p>

<p>“Great and illustrious Prince,” he said, as he stood
before the Prince of Iran, who looked upon him coldly
and suspiciously, “I have come on in advance of the
King with his permission. I have heard of the efforts
of the powerful ones to persuade you to revolt and I
know also that you believe you have just cause in the
act of the King with relation to his sisters. I have made
the Great King realize that he has committed the worst
blunder of his life and that upon your acts will not only
depend the result of this war but the continuance of his
empire. I call to your remembrance that the subject nations
are but waiting for the outbreak of civil war
amongst the Aryans to throw off the Aryan rule.
Should you revolt, every conquered nation would revolt;
and if you should succeed, you would have the world to
conquer over again. This you know as well as I. Is
it not so?”</p>

<p>He paused. The Prince of Iran inclined his head in
assent.</p>

<p>“Proceed with your message,” he said coldly.</p>

<p>“This being so,” continued Prexaspes, “I deemed it
best to come hither and tell you the facts with relation
to the King’s brother and sister. I am reliably informed
that Prince Bardya is dead. He died at the hands of
mountain robbers. Of course I do not know this for certain.
As to the Princess Athura, she escaped the same
day that the King issued his decree, a copy of which I
sent to you. He never consummated his marriage with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
her. I know that she escaped, because the King suspected
that I had aided her. As to whether I did aid
her or not, I say nothing, except that I rejoiced when
I heard it—not openly, for I apparently made every
exertion to find her. Now the King was advised to
marry his sisters by a certain Magian prophet who predicted
that a son of his sister should sit on the throne
after him. The King is impulsive and acted without
advising with me. But having married Artistone, he is
satisfied that he has complied with the prophet’s prediction;
and in order that you may know his good-will
towards you he has made a second decree, declaring that
Athura is free from wedlock with him and granting
her leave to marry whom she will. This am I directed
to place in your hand upon being satisfied that you are
firm in adherence to your oath taken to Cyrus and will
state that you will remain loyal to the King. The King
also confirms you in the office of chief commander of
this army under him. I assure you, Great Prince, that
the King is sincere, though, I frankly state, it is because
he knows that one word from you or any injury to you
would be the signal for the rebellion of all Iran save perhaps
Medea.”</p>

<p>He paused. The Prince stood in silence a moment
gazing at the floor, considering the King’s message.</p>

<p>“Will the King give me his statement as King that he
has not done injury to Athura?” he then demanded.</p>

<p>“Not only that, but he has stated in this his decree
that the marriage never has been consummated.
Furthermore I know all that happened from a private
examination of the servants who saw the King when he
went to the Princesses to announce his will to them,—how
he fled from Athura’s dagger; how he set watches
at her bedroom door; how there stood open the lattice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of a closet-window connected with the bedroom by
which she escaped; and how, afterwards, the rope ladder
by which she passed over the walls was found;
and it is even known how she purchased a horse which
later was found near Bagistan. She rode away on it
disguised as a youth. There she disappeared.”</p>

<p>The Prince started and smiled slightly when Prexaspes
mentioned the hinged lattice in the closet-window.
He had heard from Athura of this means of
egress before. He asked eagerly, “No further trace of
her has been found?”</p>

<p>“No. But the King thinks she has fled to you or to
Persia.”</p>

<p>The Prince did not answer this suggestion but held
his hand out for the decrees, saying: “Assure the King
that I accept his decree and will loyally support him.
But let him not again, I implore, place me in so grave
a position, lest I forget my vow to the great Cyrus!”
He took the decrees from the hand of Prexaspes, who
bowed low and backed from the tent with a second low
salaam.</p>

<p>So it came about that Cambyses feared not to come
on to Tyre and that the army, duly marshaled in massive
lines, received the Great King with honor. The
Prince of Iran, accompanied by Hydarnes of the foot
soldiers, Vomisces of the cavalry, and a hundred other
Persian officers, greeted the King at the limits of the
camp and followed him as he rode slowly between the
lines of soldiers to his pavilion. The soldiers knelt as
he passed, shuddering or wondering as they saw the
bloated red face and cold, glittering eyes of their ruler.
When they saw the Prince of Iran riding near his right
hand in the place of honor, they were pleased and broke
forth in acclamations, which the Great King thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
were given to him. But his countenance gave no indication
of his emotions, and his greetings to his officers
were slight and cold.</p>

<p>No sooner had the King entered his pavilion and called
for wine than Prexaspes, who had personal charge of
the King’s household, entered, and, having bent his knee,
requested leave to speak. The King said impatiently:</p>

<p>“Well, speak! Undoubtedly you come to preach policy
again! I liked not the dark looks of those cursed
Persians! I have a mind to send some of those officers
a bowstring!”</p>

<p>“Having your gracious leave, O King, I will speak
plainly,” said Prexaspes, boldly. “Does not my welfare
depend solely upon your favor? Believe that I
speak, therefore, for your best interests. There was
grave trouble brewing amongst those Persians. The
favor you have shown to the Magi and your marriage
with your sister, against which, you know, I most
strongly advised, and the grave insult thereby inflicted
upon the Prince of Iran, have stirred in them the spirit
of revolt. I have trembled, O King! My spies have
kept me well informed. There stands between you and
destruction at this moment the word of one man, and
that one is the Prince of Iran! Order me stricken
dead, if you will, O King, for speaking so boldly; but
I tell you the truth! I swear by all the gods, I speak
the truth!”</p>

<p>The King’s face was dark with wrath, but he realized
the force of his adviser’s words. He gulped down
a great cup of wine, threw the cup upon the floor, and
passed a trembling hand over his face.</p>

<p>“You may speak truth, Prexaspes,” he admitted.
“But how about the Medes and the other levies, are
they not faithful? They outnumber the Persians and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Bactrians. Besides, have I not stultified myself already
by your advice and placated that same Prince of Iran?”</p>

<p>“The Medes may be depended upon, but none others.
It is true we have placated the Prince of Iran. But
with your permission I will offer further advice.”</p>

<p>“Say on!”</p>

<p>“I advise that you send for the Prince of Iran and
personally greet him with your royal hand and assure
him of your favor as King. Thus will you fasten him
to your cause and satisfy the Aryans, by whose power
alone you may hope to prosecute this war successfully.”</p>

<p>The King broke forth in a torrent of curses and imprecations.
It was a bitter tonic that Prexaspes had
prescribed. He hated the Prince of Iran with the hatred
of jealousy and fear. He ended his explosion by saying:</p>

<p>“But the day will come when I shall surely slay
that man! Now, indeed, I see that I must dissemble.
Press me not too far on this path, Prexaspes, lest I slay
you! Go then and command him to come here. I will
dissemble. I will be as wise as a serpent—for a
time!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes bowed low and backed from the royal presence.
He sent a messenger to the Prince of Iran, who
came at once.</p>

<p>The Prince was pale but composed. He bowed low
over the King’s extended hand, saying: “I am here
at the King’s command. Let it please the King to command.”</p>

<p>The King glowered sullenly upon the Prince, but endeavored
to infuse into his tones a note of cordiality,
as he said: “Prince Hystaspis, I have trusted you
greatly, though, as you well know, no love has ever
been between us. I hear that there has been much treasonable
talk in this army.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“I know there is much dissatisfaction, O King!” answered
the Prince. “But it cannot be said to be treasonable.
The people of Iran like not the power and
place given to the fire-worshipers of the hills. The
Persians, who occupied the chief places under King Cyrus,
are grieved that they have not found favor with his
son.”</p>

<p>“We will show these proud slaves who grumble, that
the King of Kings brooks no interference!” exclaimed
the King, his anger blazing forth for an instant. “Prexaspes
has given you my decree concerning Athura. You
may rest assured that she and you may marry safely.
Where is she? Of all men, you should know.”</p>

<p>The Prince was surprised at this question, and the
manner of the King. Evidently Cambyses was endeavoring
to restrain his passions and speak pleasantly to
him.</p>

<p>“I have not seen the royal lady since I bade her
farewell at Persepolis and took with me her pledge to
marry me,” he answered. “Neither have I had a letter
from her since the day when it pleased you to make
a new law that the King might marry his sisters. Nor
have I heard what has become of her, save that I did
hear rumors that she had escaped or had been slain by
your orders.”</p>

<p>“The report that Athura is dead is not true!” said
Cambyses. “She fled from the palace the day my decree
was made and keeps well hidden, though my slaves
have searched the world for her. Find her and marry
her, if you will! You have my consent. Let that subject
be forgotten between us. Is this army ready to
march?”</p>

<p>“It is ready.”</p>

<p>“Then let the march begin on the morrow. The insults<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
we have received from Egypt’s King must be
avenged and that country added to our empire. It is
said to be very rich. I am weary with the day’s journey
and will rest. Give such orders as you deem necessary.
Cambyses, the King of Kings, remembers not the
former days. My trust and favor I give to you; and
my consent to your marriage with Athura shall not be
withdrawn.”</p>

<p>He turned away, and the Prince with a salute left
the pavilion. It seemed to the latter that the sky had
taken on a new glory and that the golden rays of the
setting sun were indicative of joy. A load had been
lifted from his heart. Athura had escaped a miserable
fate and must be still alive. One so resourceful as she
would know how to save herself. It mattered little
that Cambyses hated him. His duty demanded faithful
service to the King and his oath to the Great King
would remain unbroken. He called together his
friends among the officers and briefly informed them that
all present cause for dissatisfaction had been removed
and that he expected of them loyal service to the King.</p>

<p>On the next day the great army slowly uncoiled its
vast length and moved down the narrow coast-line of
Canaan, bearing woe to ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Egypt was ill-prepared for war. From the time that
Cyrus had reduced all Syria, including Canaan, to subjection,
the Egyptian King, Amasis, had known that a
conflict with the new world-power would come. He
had heard of the preparations for war made by Cambyses
and had endeavored to make ready. But Egypt had long
since lost its ancient vigor. Its people had become rich
and indolent. They loved not war. They depended
mainly upon foreign auxiliaries hired by their money
for their defense. Thirty thousand Greeks and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
thousand adventurers from other lands formed the main
strength of the Egyptian army. Levies drawn from an
agricultural and trading people among the Egyptians
themselves were neither practiced in war nor enthusiastic
in the service and made poor soldiers. They
were brave and many in number, but they knew little
discipline. They could not stand before the fearful rush
of the Persian cavalry or the tiger-like ferocity of the
Aryan infantry. They outnumbered the army of Cambyses,
but their very numbers were a source of weakness
because of their lack of discipline.</p>

<p>Just as the war was beginning, old King Amasis had
died, leaving his throne to a youth named Psammenitus,
who had not the skill himself nor good generals to lead
his army. But he marched forth and took position in
the desert near Pelusium, with the left of his line of
battle resting on the Great Sea and its right protecting
the water-wells and barring the main caravan road to
Egypt, determined to strike one blow in defense of his
kingdom. His Greeks were placed on the left, supported
by Cretan slingers. The center was held by
stout Ethiopian infantry, black men of ferocious courage,
armed with javelins and swords, terrible in close
contest. Behind them was a mass of Egyptians. On
the right, where the plain was more level, there were
two hundred chariots supported by a mass of irregular
cavalry, principally Arabs, armed with scimiters and
long, slender spears.</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran led the Aryan host with his thirty
thousand horsemen of the Guard, driving back the Arab
cavalry which came out to harass his advance, until the
position and extent of the Egyptian army were disclosed.
From the crest of a sand-dune near the sea,
he carefully surveyed the position occupied by Psammenitus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
It was the afternoon of a cloudless day. At
his right glistened the sea, its oily waves scarce rippling
on the shores. At his left and rear, the mountains of
Palestine were a dim cloud on the horizon. Before him
was a vast plain, gray and brown with dust and sand,
where the opposing army was making ready for battle.
He noted the orderly Greeks, the dark array of Ethiopians,
and the wheeling, clattering chariots, taking their
appointed places. The Prince was accompanied by
Gobryas and several of his chief captains, who stood
near with the light of battle in their eyes and joy in their
hearts. For the long, hot marches would end here in
victory. They did not dream of defeat.</p>

<p>The Prince soon formed his plan of battle. He directed
the Guard to take a position in a long line, with
its right resting at the sand-dune and its left thrown
back in a wide curve so as to protect the approaching
infantry from attacks of the Arabs.</p>

<p>“Let all our forces be brought up to-night and placed
in position. Let them sleep on their arms and be ready
to attack at daylight. The wells of water are in possession
of the enemy and we must have them to-morrow
or die of thirst. Here must we conquer or die. If we
lose the battle, every tribe in Syria and Armenia will
revolt and attempt to cut us off from retreat to our
homes,” said the Prince, turning to his officers after a
long survey of the field.</p>

<p>He then gave orders for placing the troops. As the
sun went down, his dusty battalions were taking their
appointed positions behind the long line of cavalry. He
placed the Persian and Medean infantry opposite the
Greeks, with its right resting on the sea. In the center
were the allied races, principally footmen. On the left
were the war-chariots, opposing the chariots of the enemy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Then the cavalry was withdrawn to the rear and
massed behind the extreme left. Imitating the tactics
of the Great Cyrus in his last battle, he intended to
make a détour to the left with the cavalry, assail the extreme
end of the enemy’s right, and roll it back to the
sea. The pack-train, camp equipage, and the King’s
pavilion were placed in the rear near the sea and enclosed
within a palisade of stakes driven into the earth.
But the King, as became a Persian warrior, bivouacked
with the soldiers, having taken his station on the sand-dunes
at the right, where he could see the field of battle.</p>

<p>Night fell upon the opposing hosts, and midnight arrived
before the final dispositions were made. Videttes
and sentinels were duly stationed, and the tired soldiers
lay down on their arms to snatch a few hours of rest.
The Prince of Iran was about to lie down on the sand
in the midst of his guard when a slave, clad in the livery
of the King, came and prayed leave to speak with him.
Bidden to speak, he said: “My gracious mistress, the
Queen, requests you to come to her if it be possible.
I am directed to guide you.”</p>

<p>The Prince hesitated. He knew that Artistone, the
younger of the King’s sisters, was referred to as the
Queen. It was the privilege of the noble Persians and
their wives to visit each other; but the King had introduced
the customs of the seraglio, the separate harem,
the veiled faces, and the seclusion of wives. The slave,
noticing his hesitation, continued: “The King is not in
his pavilion and the Queen will meet you in the tent
of her slaves. She greatly desires you to come. She
would speak of the Princess Athura.”</p>

<p>The Prince no longer hesitated. He drew Gobryas
to one side and informed him of his design. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
throwing a rough cloak about his shoulders, as a disguise,
he motioned the servant to proceed, and followed
him. They entered the palisadoed camp and went to
a tent near the King’s pavilion. The slave watched
outside while the Prince went in and met the child-wife
of the King.</p>

<p>The interior of the tent was dimly lighted by a lamp
burning perfumed oil. At one side was a low couch,
and, reclining thereon, was Artistone. He bent his knee
before her and kissed the slender white hand she held
out to him.</p>

<p>“Greeting, Prince and brother!” said she. “How
I have longed to see some one I do not fear! This
camp is full of spies, placed by the King to watch me and
the other women he has brought with him. Only in
this one slave who brought you hither and in two maidens
who dress me, have I any confidence. How good it
is to see your face!”</p>

<p>“It gives me great delight, little sister, to come at
your bidding. How may I serve you?” he returned.</p>

<p>“I hear that a great battle is about to take place. Is
it true?”</p>

<p>“It is. But have no fear of the result. We shall
scatter the enemy like sand before a desert wind.”</p>

<p>“I have no fear. I would go out and watch the battle
if I were permitted. Know you aught of Athura?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that the King said she had escaped.
Can you tell me of her?”</p>

<p>Tears filled the Queen’s eyes and wet her cheeks.
“Alas!” she said, “I fear she is dead. She locked
herself in her room after attempting to stab the King
with her dagger when he came and announced to us
his decree of marriage. The palace-guards were set
to watch at the door. I was taken away and never saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
her more. Sometimes, when the King is savage and
drunken or is displeased and desires to cause me grief,
he says that he had her tortured to death. But at other
times he says that she escaped. I hoped that she had
communicated with you. Surely she must be dead or she
would have done so!”</p>

<p>“She attempted to slay him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Her fury was terrible. The King would
have been killed had he not fled. He came to our sitting-room,
the room in the palace where we so often
played when we were children, and announced that he
would make us his wives. After some words, Athura
drew a dagger and sprang upon him. He leaped back
out of the room and ran. He shouted to the guards.
They came. She retreated to her bedroom and barred
the door. Then the King dragged me away and—I
am the most unhappy woman living! Ah! how often
I think of those pleasant days of our childhood when
our mother loved and played with us and our father
smiled upon us so graciously! Do you not remember
them? Will happiness never return to me again?
Should I die by my own hand as I am tempted?”</p>

<p>The Prince was deeply affected. His voice shook
with emotion, as he answered: “Child, it may be the
day of deliverance will come, perhaps to-morrow. Who
knows? I know not what to advise. Death is but a
step into a better existence. Did not Zoroaster, the divine,
so teach? What said Belteshazzer, the Hebrew?
He, the wisest of men, who talks with spirits, who reads
all dreams and riddles, who prophesies of the future—he
says that death is a blessed relief, in that we drop
a body which suffers and is weak, while the spirit life
is one of great glory and peace. I do not advise death.
I do not think Athura is dead. It may be she has gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
to Prince Bardya or to my father in Bactra. It is a
long way to Bactra, and it has been difficult to send
messengers. There are many reasons why she should
not communicate.”</p>

<p>Artistone shuddered and leaned nearer to him as she
whispered in a frightened manner: “But she could
not go to Bardya! I am sure that the King has murdered
him. Oh, I saw him as one slain! On the night
of the farewell feast, long after he had left the room,
the Magi were performing wonders and producing specters
and awful forms. At the last there came the pale
face of Bardya, floating in the air above them, fierce,
blood-stained, with a horrible wound in the forehead
as if made by a sword! I have heard the King mutter
in his sleep, as he lay half-drunken in the night, about
the murder of Bardya. He talks in his sleep and sees
fearful visions! He wakes trembling and shrieking
with fear. Ah, my brother, I know that Bardya is
dead!”</p>

<p>The Prince believed her and smote his knee with his
clenched fist, as he exclaimed: “The day will come
when the devil-worshipers, with their black lies and
conjuring, will be put down with a mighty hand! And
thou,” he cried, raising his face and one hand to heaven,
“O Ahura-Mazda, the only God, grant to me the opportunity
to avenge the death of Bardya, to avenge the
insults to your altars, upon that whole evil caste; and
I will declare your glory upon all the hills!”</p>

<p>“May your prayer be granted!” said the Queen, fervently.
“How the world would be blessed if some day
you should lead the hosts of truth against these evil
and idolatrous men! The nations would rejoice if you
were monarch of the world instead of this monster!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned the Prince. “My oath will permit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
no such thoughts, and it is not wise that you should
thus speak. But I must now leave you. Is there anything
I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“No, my brother. I desire you not to think evil of
me. I am not gifted with the will of Athura. I have
elected to suffer awhile in patience my strange and unnatural
position as wife of the King. Sister and wife!
Such I have heard is the evil custom of the Egyptians,
who, it is said by Phanes, the Greek, even married their
own mothers as well as their sisters, in order that their
royal race might not mingle with a less royal! Have
great care, my brother! The King would slay you if he
dared. He is jealous of you.”</p>

<p>The Prince arose and stood looking down in great
pity at the childish, careworn face of Artistone.</p>

<p>“I do not fear the King,” he said. “I am guarded
by a powerful spirit who will not permit harm to come
to me. I do not serve Cambyses, but, rather, the King
of Kings and the Aryan race. I shall go into battle,
rejoicing to fight for my people. I hope the day may
soon come when I may aid in crushing those liars who
are destroying true religion and leading Cambyses astray.
But now I must go. Should need come, send for me.”</p>

<p>He turned to leave; but she asked, while a faint color
suffused her pale cheeks: “What of the noble Gobryas?
Is he well and—happy?”</p>

<p>“He is well, but he is not happy. Gobryas has been
much pained by the action of the King in forcing you
into this unnatural marriage. May I say to him that
you remember him kindly?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Tell him that it will please me more than all
else, if he shall acquit himself well in the battle, and
that he must not too greatly endanger his life. We
know not what the future has in store. Farewell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
brother! May Sraosha place his buckler before you on
the morrow!”</p>

<p>The Prince departed quietly. The child-queen buried
her face in her arms and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>At the first gray light of morn the Prince and several
officers rode swiftly along the front of the army. As
they passed, the soldiers sprang up and shouted, clashing
their arms upon their shields and demanding to be
led to battle. He paused here and there to utter words
of direction and advice to the officers. To the center
he said: “You must move slowly forward and hold
all the ground you gain until you see the cavalry charging
the right of the enemy. Then go forward with a
rush.” To the general of the right wing he said:
“Stand fast here on the sand-dunes and attack not those
Greeks until you see the cavalry charging the Egyptian
right. Then go forward and quit you like men. For
those Greeks are brave warriors.”</p>

<p>He paused before the King, who sat on a rude throne
placed upon the summit of a hillock of sand from which
he could view the battle. “Live forever, O King!” he
said, saluting. “When it pleases you to order the battle
joined, we are ready.”</p>

<p>The King glowered at him sullenly. He was sore and
ill-natured after his night on the ground. “See to it
that you win this battle for me, or death shall be your
portion!” he said. “Let no quarter be given to those
dogs yonder, who by their impudence have brought on
them my wrath and have caused me weariness in sleeping
out here beneath the stars!”</p>

<p>“I hear your words,” replied the Prince, coldly.
“Rest assured that we shall win this battle or we shall
welcome death.”</p>

<p>“Enough!” exclaimed the King. “Join battle when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
you please! I have no appetite for talk. I have sent
for wine and will drink while you slay yonder reptile-worshipers.
I do not see their godlike calf at the front.
Have a care of his horns!” The King laughed at his
own wit.</p>

<p>Again saluting, the Prince turned his horse and galloped
off, followed by his staff. He saw that the enemy
was also making ready for battle, and he forgot the
King in the fierce joy of conflict. Placing himself at
the head of his cavalry, he gave the signal for advance.</p>

<p>Two hundred chariots sprang forward, and the long
lines of infantry moved. From the other side opposing
chariots dashed out and, in a moment, the crash of
colliding wheels and the shouts and screams of combatants
arose. The Persian cavalry rode at a brisk trot out
to the left and by a wide circuit came in upon the right
flank and rear of the Egyptians, scattering the Arabs
who vainly sought to oppose. Along the whole front,
two miles or more in extent, the battle was joined. The
sky was filled with darts. The sun, springing up from
the east, flashed upon sword and spear and upon struggling
men who stabbed and slashed and reviled and
cursed each other. The Aryan right as ordered stood
still. But the Greeks of the opposing line came forward
to the assault, like a moving wall prickly with spears,
their fair, eager faces ablaze with the light of battle;
and as they came on they shouted to Phanes daring him
to come and meet them whom he had betrayed. Slingers
and archers pelted them as they advanced; but,
partially covered by their big, round shields, they did
not halt. The Persian and Medean infantry was not
terrified, but prayed the captains for leave to charge.
The presence of the King, in whose sight they must do
or die, nerved the Aryan soldier for the contest. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the Greeks arrived at the base of the sand-dunes, the
King, disregarding the orders of the Prince of Iran,
directed his infantry to charge, and the men sprang
forward and down upon the Greeks with spears at rest.
Then was shown the splendid discipline of these mercenaries
of Psammenitus. They met the living wall of
men rolling down upon them with firm, up-thrusting
spears. The shock was terrific. The lines swayed
back and forth. The longer spears of the Greeks gave
them the advantage. Unable to reach their enemies, the
Persians impotently struggled against the iron hedge
and were thrust back. Cambyses observed the contest
with alarm. He sent in his own body-guard to aid the
hard-pressed infantry. But the Greeks moved steadily
onward. Their phalanx could not be pierced. They
seemed invincible. They surmounted the hills. But
here the uneven ground broke their formation somewhat
and enabled the Persians to press in and come to
close quarters.</p>

<p>Cambyses was no coward. He stayed with his guard,
but he began to cast about for aid. He saw the long,
swaying lines of men to his left, where the allies fought
with the fierce Ethiopians. He observed the mixed and
tangled wreckage of struggling horses and men where
the chariots had met. Looking beyond, he saw the
dense mass of Persian cavalry, led by the Prince of
Iran in person, on a magnificent white horse, wheeling
about upon the rear and right flank of the Egyptians,
driving back a cloud of Arabs. He watched the cavalry
come thundering down upon the rear of the enemy,
bringing terror and confusion. Psammenitus, who was
mounted on a fleet dromedary, also saw the coming
destruction and, terrified, fled from the field at full
speed. The Ethiopians, trodden down and overthrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
by the heavy Persian horse, lost courage and quickly
became a mob. The savage allies of the Persian line
hewed them down without mercy. In a very short space
of time none but the Greeks were left to present any
resistance. Their captains, seeing that the battle was
lost, ceased the forward movement and sought to form
their ranks in a square. Surrender was not considered,
for the hated Phanes was with the enemy. But because
of the inequalities of the ground, they were not able to
form before the Prince’s cavalry rode in upon them,
broke through their wavering lines, smote them with
maces, hewed them with swords, and stabbed them with
javelins, until few were left. They stood their ground
to the last and, in death, nobly redeemed their oaths to
Psammenitus. So, in vast slaughter, the army of the
Egyptian King disappeared, and with it fell Egypt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>THE MADNESS OF CAMBYSES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE King of Egypt fled on his swift dromedary,
while the men who had marched with him to battle
gave up their lives in his behalf and a red riot of slaughter
stained the desert sands. The Persian cavalry, now
unhindered by any organized resistance, carried death
to the despairing, panting fugitives who fled from the
contest. The Egyptian army was annihilated. Barely
did the King himself enter his city of Memphis and
close its gates ere the Prince of Iran, at the head of a
picked body of men on horses almost spent with rapid
going, appeared and demanded his surrender. The vast
array of invaders soon spread over the fertile valley
of Egypt and shut the king so closely within his city-walls
that no succor could enter and only hope could
flee. Psammenitus, unable to face a hero’s death,
bowed to the power of the King of Kings, surrendered
into his hands his crown, and acknowledged him as lord.
He took his place with other captive kings at the table
of his master and ate in bitterness of spirit the bread of
peace.</p>

<p>Victory having come to him easily, Cambyses became
puffed up and arrogated to himself divine attributes.
Secretly his heart was eaten with envy of the Prince
of Iran, the idol of the army, to whom all men attributed
the great victory. As a result, the king openly slighted
the Prince, relieved him of the general command, placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
other officers near his own person and through them
issued his orders. Leaving barely enough troops to garrison
lower Egypt, Cambyses himself led a great army
southward into Ethiopia; but, as he had failed to take
into account the vast deserts through which he had to
pass to reach that region, his army soon came to want
and starvation, and half of the soldiers composing it
died of disease and privation. Had not the Prince of
Iran asserted his prerogatives, assumed command of
the garrisons of Egypt, and gathered a great caravan
which he sent to the King’s relief, the remainder of the
ill-fated army would have perished. Undeterred by this
experience, the King sent a second expedition against
the people of the oasis of Ammon and the priests of its
great temple; but the whole army perished in a mighty
sand-storm. He contemplated a third expedition for
the reduction of Carthage and the northern littoral of
Africa; but it failed because the Phœnicians refused to
give the aid of their fleets against their kindred.</p>

<p>All of these events consumed much time. Meanwhile
in Egypt the King of Kings ruled with an iron hand.
He looked with suspicion upon everybody. Knowing
that he was loved by none, he filled his court with spies
that he might detect any who would dare even to whisper
against him. He blotted out in the blood of Psammenitus
and his relatives an incipient revolt of the
Egyptians, who, encouraged by the vast misfortunes that
had befallen the army of their conqueror, dared to dream
of liberty. He derided the Egyptian gods, closed their
temples and made granaries of them, and slew the sacred
bull, Apis, with his own sword. His jealousy led
him to murder many of his own officers. Some of the
most valiant men of the army upon slight pretext were
arrested and executed summarily; others were found
dead from the stabs of hired assassins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>The Prince of Iran now habitually wore a coat of
mail beneath his tunic, and to it he owed safety twice
from the weapons of assassins. Once in the night, as
he walked alone in the garden of the palace occupied
by him as headquarters, a man leaped upon him and
drove a javelin into his back, almost hurling him to the
earth, but, owing to the mail, only bruising him. The
assassin escaped. An arrow, shot from the shadow of
a deserted temple as he rode by, slightly wounded his
left arm and rebounded from the mail on his body.
Again the assassin escaped. Thereafter Gobryas and
other officers insisted that the Prince keep a powerful
body-guard around him; and the King, having been informed
of the attempts on his life, could not reasonably
object.</p>

<p>One day shortly after King Cambyses had departed
on his expedition against Ethiopia, the Prince walked
alone in the garden surrounding his dwelling in Memphis,
examining with much interest the flowers and
shrubs growing there. He had no duties to perform.
Others administered the civil offices. Five thousand only
of his own troopers were in the city under his command;
and except to watch them drill and see that they were
fed, he had nothing to do. His thoughts were of Athura
and of the many messengers he had dispatched to the
east in search of her. Presently as he drew near to the
street-gate, he noticed a beggar sitting by the gate apparently
resting and asleep. He glanced at the man,
whose countenance was that of a Hebrew, and was about
to turn away, when the beggar opened his eyes and at
once prostrated himself with his face in the dust.</p>

<p>“Live forever, O friend of God!” said the beggar.
“Do I indeed behold the mighty Prince of Iran?” He
spoke in the Medean dialect.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>The Prince answered: “You have said who I am.
What do you wish?”</p>

<p>“I bear a message.”</p>

<p>“Arise and deliver it.”</p>

<p>The man arose and, taking from his tunic a small
packet, delivered it to the Prince, at the same time ejaculating
with a deep sigh of relief: “Praise be to the God
of Abraham! I have kept my word to the Prophet!”</p>

<p>The Prince tore off the wrappings and unfolded a
sheet of papyrus, on which was written in a hand he well
knew:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>To my beloved, the Prince of my Soul, greeting</i>:</p>

<p>“The bearer of this letter is to be trusted even as his
master, the one who met you on the banks of the Choaspes
and showed you the spirit of your ancestor, is to be
trusted. He will tell you many things of me. He cannot
tell how much I long to be with you or how my
heart is sick with anxiety for your safety. How long
are the days! How lonely the nights! But lest the one
whose shadow darkens the world should pursue me or
injure you, I have long kept silence. Now I must hear
from you. I have promised the messenger great rewards
and I know that you will make good my promises. Send
him back to me quickly, for my soul is exceedingly weary
and sick with waiting for word from you. Farewell, beloved!”</p>
</div>


<p>The missive was unsigned, but the Prince knew from
whom it came. His heart leaped with such joy that he
became dizzy and he staggered like a drunken man. Recovering
his usual calm demeanor with a mighty effort, he
said: “Though in the guise of a beggar you come, son
of Abraham, yet do you appear to me as an angel of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
light, bringing joy to my soul such as I have not felt for
many sad days! Know you the writer of this? Have
you seen her lately? How is she? Speak, man! Great
shall be your reward!”</p>

<p>The man’s face shone with joy. The gladness he had
brought to this great one of earth was infectious. He
arose and stood in humble attitude.</p>

<p>“Great Lord,” he said. “I have not seen this star
of the morning for three months, having come hither
by a long journey; but, when mine eyes looked upon her
as I started to come hither, they were blinded by the
light of her eyes and I shaded them before the majesty
of her countenance. Like a rose of Sharon is she! Like
a cedar on Lebanon stands she, strong and beautiful!
The music of her voice is as the song of many waters
and loveliness enshrouds her as the darkness enshrouds
the moon! Behold, are not all men her slaves? They
upon whom she deigns to smile would cast themselves to
the lions if she commanded, or would fall upon their own
swords if she wished. She is well, but she is not happy;
for she speaks much of my lord, the Prince of Iran, and
sighs because she sees him not.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“She is with the prophet of God, the great Daniel,
known to you as Belteshazzer, in an oasis of the desert
of Arabia. The sons of the desert are kindred to the
prophet and they dwell happily and safely together.
None except I and her two maids know who the royal
maiden is. Most happy am I to enjoy the trust of the
great master!”</p>

<p>“Then she escaped, indeed! O thou glorious life-giving
Spirit, Ahura-Mazda, I thank thee!”</p>

<p>The Prince raised his eyes to the blue vault of heaven
and removed the helmet from his head. The Hebrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
watched him sympathetically; then, as the Prince turned
to him again, he said, “Yes, Great Lord, she escaped
from the palace at night and rode on a horse to the rock
known as Behistun on the road to Susa. There my master,
moved by the spirit, met her and took her with him
into the desert ten days’ journey west of Babylon, where
in all honor and safety they have kept her. I am requested
to bear to her again a message from you, if it
please you to give me one. Her message was unsigned
and bore no words by which its meaning would be known,
had I fallen into the hands of the King. But I can discourse
to you of her. The prophet sends to you greeting,
with words of good cheer. He bids me say that the
times and seasons are changing rapidly and that great
events will happen presently, in which you will have
large part.”</p>

<p>“Come, then, into my house, servant of Belteshazzer!”
said the Prince. “You shall have great rewards. You
shall be fed and clothed and be given riches beyond your
dreams. We will spend the remainder of this day in converse
of her and of her great protector.”</p>

<p>The Prince led the way into his dwelling, and there
his servants hurried to bathe and dress the messenger
and to set before him victual and drink. And while he
ate, his royal host sat near, plying him with questions.
It was a great day in the life of Eleazer, the scribe, servant
and confidential friend of Belteshazzer, the prophet
of God. In the years to follow, when his host had become
the mighty King of Kings, he never tired of relating
this interview to his sons and to his son’s sons,
and how the gracious Prince had talked familiarly with
him as with a friend.</p>

<p>Three days later, escorted by a strong body of Persian
cavalry, he returned by way of Damascus to Babylon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
loaded with riches. At Babylon he left his escort, resumed
his disguise, and went into the desert, bearing
with him a message from the Prince of Iran to Athura.
This related the giving of the King’s consent to their
marriage and advised her that it would be safe for her
to go to Persepolis and there dwell in seclusion with his
mother, under the guardianship of King Hystaspis, who
had returned there, until the close of the present campaign.
Then he would come and marry her, and thereafter
defy Cambyses.</p>

<p>Weary of the tent-life of the desert, she prevailed upon
Belteshazzer to go with her to Persepolis. Here he and
the philosophical King of Iran spent many happy days in
study and learned dispute, while she, protected from
danger by a strong guard of the King’s own men, resided
in comfort and safety, waiting with patience the
coming of her chosen one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King of Kings, having suffered the severe
reverses of fortune before mentioned, had abandoned
himself to drunkenness and debauchery. His evil
temper, aggravated by his reverses, was ungoverned.
On the slightest provocation, he slew servants with his
own hands or caused them to be cruelly tortured. If
his spies or favorites mentioned unfavorably an officer
or soldier, death, often accompanied by tortures, such as
flaying alive, impaling on stakes, or dismemberment, was
inflicted upon the unfortunate accused. He even dared
seize and execute several noble Persians, thus carrying
into effect his jealous resolve to reduce their haughty
spirits. Finally a day came, when a dreadful murder
forced to action a conspiracy among prominent Persians
to dethrone him.</p>

<p>Cambyses and his sister-wife were at dinner, when the
King, after alluding to her sad countenance, derisively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
said to her: “You are like these other proud, upstart
Persians, moping about with disapproving countenance!
They shall all learn to bow the knee and to fall on their
faces in the dust before me, or they shall die! Who
am I that I should bear with them? I swear by Ahriman,
that I will arrest every Persian officer; and on the
morrow twelve shall die, on the day after twelve more
shall die, and on each succeeding day a like number, until
they are finished!”</p>

<p>He banged his great fist down upon the table before
him. His sister was greatly moved. Her state of health
was such that she was extremely weak and nervous.
Her face was white and her eyes were full of horror.
The half-drunken King, noticing her look of repulsion,
was infuriated, and, calling her a vile name, shouted:
“What? Do you also defy me? Speak, craven, ere I
tear out your tongue!”</p>

<p>The spirit in the child-woman suddenly blazed up and,
arising from the couch where she had been reclining,
she stood before the brute with clenched hands and flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>“Murderer!” she cried. “You have abandoned all
good! You are all evil! You foully murdered Bardya!
You have driven Athura to her death! You have dishonored
me! Would you murder all the Aryan race?
Are you a Persian? Or are you a devil?”</p>

<p>For a moment Cambyses was too dazed to speak.
Never had any one addressed him thus. Lashed to insane
fury by her words, he sprang up with stuttering
curses, knocked the frail woman down, and jumped upon
her prostrate body with his feet, stamping and crushing
her into insensibility. The servants screamed, and some
of them endeavored to prevent him; but he drew a dagger
and stabbed one to death, wounded another, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
drove all out of his presence. Then, recovering his
senses somewhat and stricken with remorse, he knelt at
the side of his sister and wept aloud. He then called
for his surgeons and bade them save her or die. They
tried faithfully to restore her to consciousness, but without
avail. She died within the hour.</p>

<p>This horrible crime soon became known among the
Persians. There were then encamped near Memphis
about fifty thousand men, the remnant of the Aryans who
had followed the King into Egypt. Conferences were
at once held among the Persian officers and it was decided
that Cambyses, being insane, should be deposed.
The Prince of Iran had no part in these deliberations.
With Gobryas and a body-guard, he had gone to visit
the nearest pyramids and had been absent several days.
Spies duly reported to the King the discontent of the
army. On the next day after the murder of his sister,
the King caused the arrest of fifty of the chief officers
of the army, many of them sons of the highest nobility
of Iran. True to his oath, taken before his sister, he
slew twelve of them and caused their heads to be hung
on the gates of the city with an inscription warning all
traitors of a like fate. At once there was a vast uproar.
The Aryan troops arose in a mass and marched into
Memphis to seize the King. A bloody battle took place
in the gardens of the King’s palace, in which the King’s
body-guard was cut in pieces and its remnants driven
into the palace, where behind heavy gates and doors
they pantingly awaited death. Prexaspes commanded the
body-guard and made a brave defense. But the veteran
Persians and Bactrians were not to be repulsed. They
were about to batter down the palace gates, when the
Prince of Iran arrived. Immediately the infuriated men
raised a roar of welcome and thrust upon him at once the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
chief command, begging him to lead them and to allow
them to set him up as King.</p>

<p>The King was not deficient in physical courage. Sobered
at last by the awful results of his fury in the murder
of his sister, and caring little what the end of this
revolt might be, desperate and savage, ready to fight to
the end, he paced back and forth behind the battlements
surrounding the roof of the great palace wherein he was
besieged, and glowered sullenly down upon the raging
mob below. Prexaspes came to him, ostensibly for orders
but really to advise that overtures of peace be made.
To him the King said rabidly: “What! Will you turn
against me also? Why not go down and join those?
Perhaps they will honor you! Saw you not that Prince
of Iran out yonder? I thought I saw him ride up. Even
now, if I mistake not, he stands yonder in the midst of
his officers planning how best to take me. Bring up a
dozen of the best archers. Him at least shall they
slay!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes shook his head impatiently, and, while keeping
his eye on the King lest the latter might attack him,
he said harshly: “Have I not said that the Prince of
Iran is oath-bound to you? He alone can save you this
day! Would you slay the only man who can call off those
wolves yonder? It is madness to slay him. We shall be
torn limb for limb if he save us not!”</p>

<p>The King did not answer immediately. He watched
the movements of the mob with tiger-like eyes. He saw
Prince Hystaspis pass slowly through the mob and observed
that the officers were also passing back and forth
shouting orders. He saw the men falling in with orderly
precision and, in a few minutes, that the mob had become
an army. Company after company formed in the open
garden and the adjacent streets, until on all sides of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
palace a solid cordon of men stood at rest with officers
duly advanced before them. Prexaspes waited impatiently
for orders, but the King only ordered wine to be
brought.</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran had said to the officers who were
directing the mob: “Captains of Iran, I am grieved
to the heart! Never before have the Aryans turned on
their King in this manner and assaulted his high Majesty!
But the provocation has been great! Nevertheless,
if the Aryans rule the world, they must obey their
kings! By your act you have forfeited your lives and
under the law are as dead men! I will go to the King
and seek his pardon for you and for those he now holds
in prison. Speak to the men and say that I, the Prince
of Iran, their commander, order them to desist until I go
to the King and return!”</p>

<p>Up spoke a grizzled veteran, who had campaigned with
Cyrus: “O most beloved Prince, go not to the King!
Does he not hate you? Has he not without cause murdered
his brother and his two sisters? Why do the heads
of our comrades hang on yonder walls? By the great
God, we have sworn that he shall release the others or
die! He is a madman, and it is no treason to dethrone
him. Go not to him! He will slay you also!”</p>

<p>The Prince looked upon the rugged face of the speaker
with love, but he said reprovingly: “I know your heart,
Arbax; but you forget that he is the son of Cyrus, the
Great King. What of me? Have I not suffered at his
hands? Yet do I counsel obedience. Will you not be
guided by me?”</p>

<p>“Always and forever!” answered Arbax. “But is it
not just to demand that he release our officers as well as
pardon the men?”</p>

<p>“It is just. If he refuse, then indeed is he mad and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
you do well to take him from the throne. I will go to
him demanding this. Will you abide the result?”</p>

<p>A common assent was given by all. Only Gobryas,
whose soul was bitter because of the death of Artistone,
exclaimed: “Prince and brother, let me carry this demand
to the King, and you remain here! If he refuse
our request, or slay me, it will matter little. There may
be no need of further rioting! Let me go in your stead.”</p>

<p>But the Prince shook his head. To send Gobryas
meant to send death to the King, as the latter, he knew,
was in a mood to slay the monster who had crushed the
life out of the woman he loved.</p>

<p>“Have patience, my brother,” said the Prince. “The
state is above all else. Shall we slay our King and
plunge the whole world into anarchy? Every subject
nation would revolt. We are in the midst of our enemies
and far from home with a weakened army. Terror
of the King of Kings lies heavy upon the subject-peoples.
It must not be removed now. No, the time is
not ripe! Iran must be prepared to set up another King
before throwing down this one. The King will see the
justice of our demands.”</p>

<p>Another captain spoke up, voicing the decision of all:
“We will obey you, as our commander. But our brothers
must be released and pardon extended to all. If
you return not in one half-hour with their pardon, we
storm the palace and slay every man therein. We swear
it!”</p>

<p>“We swear it!” echoed all.</p>

<p>“Do as you say!” answered the Prince. “But I will
return. Fear not for me! One higher than I goes with
me. Remain here and let the men not move from their
places.”</p>

<p>He departed at once to the palace-gate, and, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
guards peering forth from loopholes at its sides he commanded:
“Open! I go to the King, bearing peace!”</p>

<p>The door was swung back to admit him. The guards
had expected only death at the hands of the savage men
who stood around the palace in silent, menacing attitude,
and peace they greatly desired. The Prince was
conducted to the roof, where he found Prexaspes and
the King. The latter had seated himself at a small table
and was drinking wine. He turned to the Prince, who
was startled at the sight of his haggard face, his bloodshot
eyes, and trembling hands—trembling, not in fear,
but from nervousness and debauchery. The King’s voice
was full of bitterness and hate, as he said: “Prince of
Iran, I bid you welcome! Your eyes are doubtless glad
to behold your King at the mercy of yonder rabble!
What come you for? My crown?”</p>

<p>The Prince saluted the King gravely and looked down
upon him with ill-concealed disgust and pity. He said
in cold, measured tones: “King of the World, the day
has come when even I am unable to restrain the soldiers
of Iran. Those men and their fathers made your father
King of Kings, King of the World, the Great King.
They have added Egypt to your empire. How have you
rewarded them? Think you that without these Aryans
and their officers whom you have imprisoned, you could
sit here in safety one day? Not so! These Egyptians,
these Syrians and Babylonians, serve you not because
they love you, but because they fear our soldiers. Are
you mad? Why have you given yourself over to murder
and debauchery? Why have you forsaken your God
and allied yourself with the vile Magi? I speak plainly
but loyally. I am oath-bound to support you, but I
swear that unless you now be advised by me, I will do
nothing to save you from these men, who thirst to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
avenge the blood of Bardya, of Artistone, and of these
others you have slain without just cause!”</p>

<p>The King’s face grew purple with rage. He sprang
to his feet and half-drew his sword. But his eyes, looking
into the eyes of the Prince, saw in them a fierce, savage
light and a compelling gaze that drove him back to
his seat. He dared not lift his hand against this man.
A chill of abject fear ran through his body; and he saw,
as if by revelation, a hideous chasm opening before
him. Into that chasm of present and eternal destruction
he had been about to leap. He drew back and shudderingly
covered his face with his hands. His nerves were
unstrung by debauchery and by his fearful crimes. He
had come to a place where, in the face of death, he realized
how evil his life had been. It was true, as he now acknowledged
to himself, that the position he held was due
to the men he had slighted, insulted, imprisoned, or murdered.
He was silent a moment, and as he sank back
upon his chair he weakly passed a hand across his eyes
and said: “What do you advise? Your words are true!
I have been mad, but now I am restored to reason and
I see clearly.”</p>

<p>The Prince was surprised. He had not expected such
sudden change. He thought rapidly, not only for the
present safety of the King, but for the good of the Aryan
race. A friendly, cordial note sounded in his voice, as
he answered: “Be advised by me, O King! Put away
from you the Magi. Put aside these Medean favorites.
Surround yourself with men of your own race and fill
the high offices of the empire with its nobility. Renounce
the witchcraft of the fire-worshipers and proclaim to the
world the rule of Ahura-Mazda. Pardon the men in rebellion
and release all prisoners. Bestow compensation
upon the widows and relatives of those you have slain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Then will the people of Iran support you and yours on
the throne forever. Then will your reign become truly
great and glorious!”</p>

<p>The King remained silent a long time after the Prince
ceased speaking. A good impulse stirred within his
heart. Life had been without happiness to him since
that fatal night when he had ordered Bardya slain.
Hate, envy, and malice towards the best men of his own
race had filled his heart. Remorse over his brother’s
fate had been with him, but it was as nothing to the remorse
and grief gnawing his soul over the death of Artistone,
the gentle sister and wife whom he really loved.
Could he ever atone? He would try.</p>

<p>“Let it be done as you say,” he commanded, rising
unsteadily and shaking himself as if he would shake
off a horrible dream. “Prexaspes, you shall write decrees
to fulfill all that our beloved Prince advises. So
be it! I turn back into the old ways of my fathers.
I will dismiss the Magi. I will fill all chief offices with
Persians. I will dismiss my new body-guard of Medes,
and you, Prince, shall furnish the new Imperial Guard
and command it. Write a decree, Prexaspes, making
this Prince the chief man in my empire after the King.
Evermore will I be guided by his advice. The Magi
must go down and back to their haunts in the hills. The
temples of Ahura-Mazda shall open; and I will offer a
thousand sacrifices to atone for my sins. Order the prisoners
released. Write an address to be read to the army,
telling of my new resolve. I will go down to the soldiers
and tell them this myself!”</p>

<p>“Not so, O King!” said the Prince. “Let me deal with
these men. Let your decrees be prepared and signed at
once. I will go down, release the imprisoned officers and
return to the army with them. This, O King, may be a
great day for good to the Aryan race!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“Let every order given by the Prince of Iran be
obeyed,” said the King to Prexaspes.</p>

<p>The latter bowed low, and, followed by the Prince,
departed immediately to release the imprisoned officers,
and in a few moments these went forth to join the rejoicing
troops. The palace gates were thrown open, its
defenders marched out and departed to a distant garrison,
and a new guard of Persians was placed in charge.
The Prince of Iran, having secured the decrees and published
them, assumed charge of the King’s affairs. Thirty
days of mourning for Artistone were observed. Compensation
for the death of those slain by the King’s orders
and banishment of the Magi from affairs of state followed.</p>

<p>King Cambyses determined to return to Medea in
order to complete the work of restoring to power the
Persian faction. Aryandes, a noble Persian, was appointed
satrap of Egypt and the bulk of the army was
left with him. The King, with a guard of ten thousand
Persians and an army of fifty thousand mixed troops,
escorting a vast train loaded with the wealth of Egypt,
marched by easy stages out of the latter country, through
Canaan, along the shore of the Great Sea, to a point near
Mount Carmel, where he turned towards Damascus.
The curses of Egypt went with him. Her priests, under
the milder rule of the sane Aryandes, then returned to
her deserted temples. But so broken were the Egyptians
and so strong was the Persian hold that no rebellion occurred.
The Egyptian people, having learned that while
the Persian King might be harsh yet his rule in the main
was just, did no more than dream of revolution; and for
a century Egypt slept peacefully beneath the paw of the
Persian lion.</p>

<small>THE END OF OATH-KEEPING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER resting some days by the sea near Mount
Carmel, the King’s army moved eastward towards
Damascus, passing north of Lake Chinneroth and south
of Mount Hermon, through the ancient land of Bashan,
and so came to the small city of Hamath near the head-waters
of the Jordan.</p>

<p>Since leaving Egypt the King had kept himself secluded,
either riding in a closed litter carried on the
shoulders of stout slaves, or staying within his tent. He
was gloomy and morose. He brooded much alone, and
when in his darkest moods was a savage and unreasonable
maniac. The Persian cavalry, of which his body-guard
was composed, regarded him with ill-suppressed
hatred. The remainder of the army was disaffected and
mutinous. A factional spirit had sprung up among the
soldiers. The different nationalities and religions
clashed. Especially did the Aryan monotheists despise
the worshipers of many gods and the devil-worship of
the Magi. Only the strong hand of the Prince of Iran,
for whom all had respect, could repress disorder and enforce
discipline.</p>

<p>The King halted a day at Hamath and allowed the
army to rest before entering the desert road for Damascus.
The Prince of Iran mounted his favorite horse
and, accompanied by Gobryas and a score of men, rode
out towards Mount Hermon. As they were about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
ascend the lower hills, they met a runner or message-bearer,
coming down from the mountain, who, when he
saw the Prince, stopped running and bowed himself to
the earth. The Prince halted. He saw that the man
was a Hebrew.</p>

<p>“Do not mine eyes behold the great lord, the mighty
Prince of Iran?” asked the runner.</p>

<p>“I am he,” answered the Prince.</p>

<p>The man produced a roll from his close-fitting tunic
and handed it to the Prince, who, greatly surprised,
opened and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Greeting to the royal Prince, Darius of Iran, son of
King Hystaspis! May God have you in favor! Hearing
that you are with the great army near Hamath, and
having much to say of those you love well, I pray that you
will appoint a time and place where I may meet you. I
do not think it best to come into the King’s camp, unless
you may assure me of a safe escort. My trusty servant,
Joseph, will bear safely to me any message you may
send. If you would visit me, he will guide you to my
tent.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Farewell,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Belteshazzer</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince’s heart leaped with joy. Once only had
he heard from the Princess Athura, and he knew not
whether she had taken his advice and gone to Persepolis.
Perhaps she had chosen to stay with Belteshazzer and
was now with him. He handed the letter to Gobryas to
read and said to the messenger: “I will go to your
master. Lead the way!”</p>

<p>The messenger again saluted and, turning his face to
the mountain, led the way with a long swinging stride,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
going so swiftly that the horses of the Persians occasionally
galloped to keep near him. The road wound upward
around the spurs of the mountain. Having surmounted
a high ridge, they came at length upon a small
plateau several acres in extent, from which the rugged
heights went up still farther and upon which were several
cedar and fir trees. At one side a dashing torrent
poured out from a gulch, spread out in a swirling pool,
leaped over a rocky barrier, and disappeared into a canyon.
Near the pool on a grassy plot was a pavilion
of dark cloth and, clustered near it, a score of lesser
tents. Several horses grazed on the green before the
tents, and a group of men armed with bows and spears
stood near the pavilion. As the Persians drew near,
a man of stately and benign aspect emerged from it and
spoke reassuringly to the men, who were uneasily regarding
the newcomers as possible enemies. Then he
remained standing at the tent-door and waved a hand
in greeting to the Prince. It was Belteshazzer. The
Prince spurred his steed forward and, dismounting, hastened
to Belteshazzer, embraced him affectionately, and
kissed both his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Hail, Master,” he exclaimed. “How long it has been
since I last saw you! Are you well?”</p>

<p>“My health is excellent, my son,” answered the Hebrew,
cordially. “Glad indeed am I to behold you!
Bid your men dismount. My servants shall set food before
them and attend to their horses.”</p>

<p>He called a servant to him and gave the Prince’s retinue
in his charge. Then he led the Prince into the
pavilion and caused him to sit down and partake of refreshments.
The Prince looked about him expectantly,
but was disappointed in finding no indications that
Athura was in the camp. Belteshazzer knew his thoughts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
and smilingly said: “She is not here, my son. When
we received your letter bidding her go to your father,
we considered your advice good and traveled thither
by easy journeys. We were guests of your father many
months. I left her there under his protection and in the
love and care of your mother, when I journeyed hither.
She was well. More beautiful than the morn, sweeter
than the roses that bloom in Persian gardens, as pure
as the snows of Demavend, she waits for you! Your
father has established such a strong guard around his
palace that it resembles a camp; and none go in or come
out who are not known.”</p>

<p>“My gratitude is unspeakable, O Prophet of God!”
said the Prince, fervently. “If there shall ever be any
favor I may render you, it shall be rendered. Have
you ever loved a woman? And know you the pain of
separation from her?”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer sighed as he answered: “Yea, I have
known the love of a wife. But she has gone before
and awaits me on the shore of the river of life. Like
a spring of water and a green tree in a desert, is the
love of a good woman. I have much to tell you, my son;
but I know you desire me to speak of her most.”</p>

<p>He then related the manner of Athura’s escape from the
palace of Cambyses at Hamadan, and the manner of her
life since. Then he gave to the Prince a large packet,
containing letters from the Princess, from King Hystaspis,
and from the Queen-mother.</p>

<p>“Now,” he continued, “having told you that which
you wished most to know as a man, I must speak with
you of matters of state in which you are concerned as a
Prince and as the King to be. Even as you drew near,
it was given me of the spirit to perceive that this day
is full of mighty portent. Even now there enter men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
into the King’s camp bearing news that will shake the
King’s soul. I have also received from trusty agents
within the week great news that has traveled to others
less swiftly. Evil men have seized the government of
the world at Hamadan. Patatheites, the regent, has
brought forth one whom he calls Bardya, the King’s
brother, and has proclaimed him King of Kings. He
has caused a decree to be published remitting all taxes
for three years, declaring that Cambyses is a maniac and
possessed of evil spirits, and ordering that he be apprehended
and imprisoned. You are surprised. Well may
you be. But fear not. It is not Bardya that reigns, but
an impostor. He is that Gaumata whom the Great King
maimed by cutting off his ears. Evil has been the life
of Cambyses, but not so evil as are the lives of those men
who have usurped power.”</p>

<p>The Prince uttered an exclamation of wonder and incredulity.</p>

<p>“But is Bardya dead? How knew you this? How
can that Gaumata hope to impersonate him long?”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer smiled and remained silent for a moment.
His eyes were fixed as if looking within, and
he assumed a listening attitude, as one might in revery.
Presently he spoke softly and dreamily:</p>

<p>“Yea, I see them even now sitting in a room of the
great palace! Patatheites paces up and down, his pale,
sharp countenance wreathed in a triumphant smile. Gaumata,
the earless one, sits on the throne, uneasy and
afraid. He wears a turban low down on his head after
the fashion of the Arabs, but it is to conceal his lack of
ears. He resembles Bardya, but he is Gaumata. He
has shown himself to the people, who have acclaimed
him. He awaits uneasily the return of messengers sent
to all parts of the earth. In him the Magi triumph and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Ahriman, that old serpent, the devil, rules. God is forgotten.
As I said, even now there run into the King’s
camp at Hamath the emissaries of the false Bardya.
They are proclaiming the decree aloud to the wondering
soldiers. They are distributing copies to all who
can read. A mighty spirit of unrest broods over the
army!”</p>

<p>He paused and Prince Hystaspis sprang to his feet,
exclaiming: “Then there is need that I return to the
army at once! It loves not the King. But is Bardya
truly dead, O Prophet of God? Out of all your divine
wisdom assure me of this. Direct my course. Tell me of
the future. Not while I live shall the usurper throw
down the seed of Cyrus from his throne!”</p>

<p>He paused. A tremor passed over the face of Belteshazzer,
and with half-closed eyes he continued the low,
even-toned words of the seer:</p>

<p>“My son, Bardya is dead! He was slain by Prexaspes
in pursuance of the King’s command. A sword-stroke
from behind, as they rode northward out of Hamadan,
was given by the Mede, with such power that it
cleft the Prince’s head to the eyes. Have no doubt of
this. I have seen it in visions and heard it of the spirit.
What of the future? I see Cambyses dead! I see raised
on high one with the countenance of Darius, son of Hystaspis,
like an eagle; and he looks at the sun and spreads
his wings over the whole world. More I cannot see.
God does not decree all things; but He brings to pass
that which He does decree. He controls not the wills
of men, nor forces them to do good or evil. But in accord
with His mighty purpose, He ordains that you, O
son of Hystaspis, shall rule the world; and it shall come
to pass! Fear not! Go forward! Cast down the liars
of earth and those that delude the people to their hurt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
idolaters and worshipers of earthly things! Restore
again the altars of God. With great power shall you
rule and give peace and justice to the peoples of the
earth.”</p>

<p>“But it is not required that I raise my hand against
Cambyses?”</p>

<p>“No. It is not required. The King is his own avenger.”</p>

<p>“Come with me, beloved Master. I need your advice
and guidance.”</p>

<p>“I will come to you at Hamadan in due time, my son.
Now I go down to Jerusalem to encourage my people.
When you come to your high estate, remember my people,
who languish in foreign lands. The Great Cyrus
decreed their return, but died before it could be accomplished.
Let them return and rebuild the temple of God
and live happily beneath the shadow of the King of
Kings.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you, O Belteshazzer, it shall be done!
Your God is my God. Is is not so? Your people shall
be even as the Aryans, favored of me, when I sit on the
throne.”</p>

<p>“Yea, it is so. God is a spirit. Ahura-Mazda, the
good spirit, is the same as Elohim. Have we not so decided,
your father and I, in discourse by the Pulwar?
Truly your father is a man of knowledge!”</p>

<p>“He sat at the feet of Zoroaster in his youth. Has
age touched him and my mother harshly?”</p>

<p>“No. Their eyes are undimmed. Their hearts are
young. Age but puts wisdom into them.”</p>

<p>Many other questions, of his home, of his parents, and
of Athura, asked the Prince. Servants having spread a
lunch beneath an awning before the pavilion, he and
Gobryas sat down with Belteshazzer and refreshed themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
It was an inspiring scene. To the west and
north were the rugged spurs and ridges of Mount Hermon.
Below and to the east was the great plain spreading
out towards Damascus and Edom. The sparkling
cascade with its soft rush of waters, the song of birds,
the brilliant sunlight over all, were elements of an impression
on the mind of the Prince that he never forgot.
From this point he set out to seize the throne of the
world. Convinced that the great prophet spoke truly, he
now set his gaze on the greatest place of power in all the
earth and went steadily towards it. But he did not linger
here. With the blessing of Belteshazzer ringing in his
ears, he hastened back to the army.</p>

<p>As he rode into camp, he saw evidence of excitement
and turmoil. His ten thousand Persians composing the
body-guard were standing in battle-array, in a hollow
square around the King’s pavilion, with officers pacing
back and forth at the several fronts in gloomy silence.
A vast concourse of men was gathered near around a
speaker, who, mounted on a chariot, was haranguing
them. A roar of voices arose as the speaker paused and
pointed towards the Prince and his party.</p>

<p>“Long live Bardya! Down with Cambyses! Hail to
King Bardya! Slay the murderer of his sister!
Death to the tyrant!” were some of the shouts that
came to the Prince’s ears. He paused but an instant to
listen. Then, riding up to one of the officers of the
guard, he demanded, “What means this?”</p>

<p>“Praise God you have come!” answered the officer,
joyfully. “Now we shall know what to do. Messengers
have come from Damascus bearing copies of a decree
from Bardya, the King’s brother, announcing that
he has assumed the throne of the King of Kings and
has been crowned at Hamadan. He decrees that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Cambyses be seized and brought to him so that he may
be punished for the murder of the King’s sister; and he
also promises peace and remission of taxes. Here is a
copy. We of the guard knew not your pleasure,
whether we should defend King Cambyses or deliver
him as a prisoner to your hand. So we have surrounded
the King’s pavilion and are ready to do your will.”</p>

<p>The officer presented a roll of papyrus to the Prince,
who quickly read it. Then the Prince directed all the
officers to come before him and said:</p>

<p>“Men, as to this report that Bardya has set himself
up for King, I know that Bardya is dead and he who is
set up on high is an impostor. The liars of the hills
have done this thing, having heard of the King’s decree
that they shall be cast down from their places. Order
the soldiers to remain steadfast and resist those men
who have stirred up mutiny. Say to them that I, their
Prince, have spoken, and my word they must obey. No
impious hand shall be laid upon Cambyses, the King!”</p>

<p>The officers were amazed. But they doubted not the
words of their commander, and went along the lines,
repeating to the excited soldiery his words. He, dismounting,
went alone into the King’s pavilion. A
trembling slave announced him to the King and admitted
him to the presence. He found Cambyses pacing
back and forth in great agitation.</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the King, “you have returned!
I thought you too had turned from me. How is it that
rebellion has broken loose in this camp? Are you not
commander? You shall answer for it with your head!
But perhaps you come to tell me that I am a prisoner!
And you will put me in chains and take me to Bardya!”</p>

<p>The Prince saluted gravely and stood with uncovered
head. “I come to assure you that the Guard and I intend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
to defend you against any attack,” he said. “Is it
your order that we arrest the mutineers and punish
them?”</p>

<p>The King paused in amazement. He was incredulous
and shaken. He could not believe that this man, who
had suffered such wrongs at his hands, would not seize
him and carry him to Bardya. He believed that
Prexaspes had been faithless in executing his order to
slay Bardya and that the latter had seized an opportune
time to appear and claim the throne. His army in
mutiny, what chance had he to regain his lost throne?
He passed a trembling hand uncertainly over his haggard
face.</p>

<p>“I am mightily shaken,” he said nervously. “The
words of a sorcerer ring in my ears. He said that I
should die at Hamadan. I thought you had come to
seize me and carry me thither to death. I thought
Bardya dead! Prexaspes so reported. Where is this
Prexaspes? Let him be brought hither!”</p>

<p>He jerked a cord connecting with a bell in the servants’
quarters. A servant instantly appeared.</p>

<p>“Send Prexaspes hither!” commanded the King.</p>

<p>They waited in gloomy silence until Prexaspes came.
There was a mocking light in the Mede’s dark eyes and
a perceptible sneer on his face as he met the King’s
savage gaze. He bowed low to both the King and the
Prince.</p>

<p>“Hark you!” exclaimed Cambyses. “Hear those
cries! They acclaim Bardya King! Did you not swear
to me that my brother was dead?”</p>

<p>“I did swear, O King!” answered Prexaspes, coolly.
“Here was my authority to slay him.”</p>

<p>He drew a paper from his tunic and deliberately
handed it unrolled to the Prince, who glanced at it. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
was the order of King Cambyses to slay Bardya. The
King’s face grew livid with wrath.</p>

<p>“Thus commanded,” continued Prexaspes, “I rode
with Bardya along the Rhages road after leaving the
hall where the King gave a feast in his honor. I returned
and reported that I had slain Bardya with a
sword-stroke from behind. But he died not, it seems.
Why should I have the blood of kings on my hands?”</p>

<p>The Prince studied the Mede’s face with growing
rage. The latter’s bold gaze fell before the accusing
fury of the Prince’s eyes. The King seemed speechless.
The Prince smote his hands together, and burst
forth: “By the living God, you both deserve the death
of murderers! Why should I interfere with the wrath
of God? You lie, Prexaspes! I know the truth!”</p>

<p>He cast the order at the King’s feet and without ceremony
turned and left the tent. The King turned upon
Prexaspes with maniacal fury.</p>

<p>“Villain! Dog!” he screamed. “Why show that
order? You know that my only hope depends on the
Prince! Now you have turned him from me! You
shall be skinned alive! Your heart shall be cut out and
given to swine! You shall hang on a stake!”</p>

<p>Prexaspes laughed and snapped his fingers in the
King’s face.</p>

<p>“I fear you not, foul beast!” he shouted. “Your
day has come, as comes the day of every villain,
whether crowned or not! Am I to die? I know it. I
read death in the eyes of the Prince. I also read your
death there, son of Ahriman! Listen! You slew my
son, in cruel sport, one day. The arrow that cleft his
brain killed my loyalty to you. I know a lingering death
awaits you at Hamadan or I would myself slay you
now!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>For a moment the King was so astonished as to be
speechless. Then, roaring inarticulate curses, he sought
for his sword. But it was not at his side. He rushed
about the tent searching for it. Prexaspes, laughing derisively,
disappeared through the rear door. The King
presently found a long dagger in a pile of armor and
with it rushed out after Prexaspes. But though he
searched through the servants’ quarters, he did not find
him. He returned to his pavilion and after pacing back
and forth a moment went out in front of his quarters,
uncertain what course to pursue.</p>

<p>A vast mob of soldiers, waving arms and shouting
maledictions upon Cambyses, was moving down upon
the Persian square. The Prince of Iran was mounting
his horse, while several orderlies were galloping along
the tense lines of the Guard delivering orders to the
captains. A squad of cavalry under Gobryas was
marching towards the King’s tent.</p>

<p>“They come to arrest me!” muttered the King.
“But I shall not be taken alive! Prexaspes lied. My
brother lives and the world turns to him. He will
surely slay me, knowing that I ordered him slain. If I
die, I will die as a King!”</p>

<p>A sudden high resolve entered his soul. He went
back into the tent, placed the crown and tiara, which he
wore on state occasions, on his head, threw over his
shoulders a long purple cloak, composed his countenance
to a calm dignity, and, with the long, keen dagger
in his hand, again went forth. Gobryas and his troopers,
who were under orders to place the King in their
midst and to cut their way out and escape with him
should the Guard be unable to repulse the expected attack,
opened up to let the King pass through. The
Prince was riding towards the mob intent on a parley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
before the necessity of bloodshed should come. The
King passed through the ranks of the Guard and halted
at ten paces in front. The leaders of the mob, seeing
him, suddenly halted at a hundred paces’ distance and
fell silent, astonished at the appearance of the terrible
Cambyses. The Prince, turning to investigate the cause
of the mob’s action, saw Cambyses look a moment at
the low, western sun and around at the sky and distant
mountains, and at last turn his burning eyes upon
the hostile faces of his subjects. Then, with a swift
motion, the King elevated the gleaming dagger and
plunged it into his own chest. A cry of horror involuntarily
rose from the throng. The King swayed, his
knees bent, and he fell prone upon the earth. The
Prince, realizing what the King had done, turned upon
the mob and shouted: “Back to your tents, scoundrels!
You have slain your King! Back, I say, before I let
loose the Guards upon you!”</p>

<p>An immediate backward movement of the mob took
place, and it melted away in awed silence. The Prince
rode quickly back to the King, and, assisted by his
officers, carried the injured man into the tent. Surgeons
were called, the dagger removed, and the wound
bandaged. The blade had failed to reach the heart, but
had passed through a lung and inflicted a fatal wound.
The shock had rendered the King insensible. Blood
poured from his mouth, but he did not die immediately.</p>

<p>Night had fallen before the King regained consciousness.
He opened his eyes and looked at the flaring
lamps, as if wondering whether they were torches in
the underworld, and at the soft-footed attendants as if
wondering whether they were lost souls. His eyes presently
rested upon the Prince of Iran, who stood at the
foot of his couch with folded arms looking sadly down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
upon him. Recognition arrested his wandering mind.
He strove to rise, muttering feebly, “Then I am not
dead!”</p>

<p>An attendant sought to restrain him. Blood gushed
from his mouth, and he fell back with a bubbling groan.
After resting a moment and clearing his throat, he said
with difficulty: “Let all retire save the Prince. I am
about to die. Let me die in peace.”</p>

<p>At a nod from the Prince, the attendants left the
room. The Prince drew near to the head of the couch.
The King looked up at him and spoke in weak, halting
words:</p>

<p>“Strange it is, Prince of Iran, that you alone stand by
me in death! A thousand times I have planned your
death, but my hand has ever been held. I have done
you wrong. But in you alone have I trusted. How is
it that I have hated yet trusted you?”</p>

<p>The Prince shook his head. “I know not,” he said.</p>

<p>“But it is fate!” continued the King. “What of the
future? Where now are the wise men? Where those
prophets of the hills who predicted good fortune, who
said that my seed should sit on the throne, who said I
would conquer all my enemies and die at Hamadan?
Would God that I had heeded the words of the prophet
Belteshazzer, when he sought to teach me how to live
rightly! Where is that Belteshazzer? I wish that he
were here!”</p>

<p>He paused. There was a rustle of the curtain at the
tent-door. It drew aside and the tall, majestic presence
of Belteshazzer came into the tent. The musical, quiet
voice of the prophet said, “I am here, O King Cambyses!”</p>

<p>Cambyses stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“What wonder is this?” he exclaimed. “Am I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
dreaming? Is this a vision? Are you that prophet,
Belteshazzer?”</p>

<p>“I am Belteshazzer, the Hebrew,” answered the
prophet. “Your life is almost ended, Cambyses. What
do you demand of me?”</p>

<p>“I demand to know what awaits me in the future.
About to die, I would atone for many grievous sins.
What of the future? What of God? What of forgetfulness
through eternity to come?”</p>

<p>Belteshazzer’s countenance exhibited both pity and
sternness, as he answered, “Your time is short to atone
for the grievous sins of your life, O King. The blood
of many cries against you from the ground. Through
long years to come, wherever your soul may wander,
the evil you have done will be with you and bitterness
will be your portion. But God, the great and only God,
is a loving Father; and, perhaps, if you humble yourself
and repent, you may at length win His forgiveness and
favor. There will be no forgetfulness without forgiveness.
Greatly have you sinned. Deeply must you repent.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have sinned greatly,” murmured the King.
“In frantic wrath I slew my sister-wife! In willful
oppression I drove my sister Athura to her death—”</p>

<p>“She is not dead,” interrupted Belteshazzer. “She
lives!”</p>

<p>“Praise be to Ahura-Mazda!” said the King. “Now
I know what that Magian meant, when he said that a
son of my sister shall sit on the throne of the King of
Kings. For she shall marry the Prince of Iran. I feel
upon me the spirit of prophecy! Prince of Iran, you
shall be King of Kings! In the presence of Belteshazzer,
I declare you my successor. Marry Athura. I give
her to you. She is your wife. Thus do I atone for one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
sin. But that other prophet lied when he said I should
die at Hamadan. For I die here in the Syrian desert.”</p>

<p>“Did he say Hamadan of Medea?” inquired Belteshazzer.
“If not, he spake truly. For this village
where you are encamped is named Hamath, which is
Syrian for Hamadan.”</p>

<p>The King gasped. “Then he spake truly!” he said.
“He was not of the Magi. He was a hermit, alone in
the mountains. He reproved me one day—and he was
slain. Truly have I sinned! I have slain the prophets
with the sword!”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment. Blood choked him and he
coughed. The Prince gently aided him. The King’s
strength was rapidly failing. His voice was gone and
he whispered hoarsely, “O that I might see those I have
wronged and of them seek pardon!”</p>

<p>He fell silent and his eyes were partially closed.
Presently he shuddered and opened his eyes wide. He
half rose, stared in amazement and terror towards the
foot of his couch, and raised his hand as if to ward off
a blow. The Prince, following the direction of the
King’s gaze, saw (or did he dream?) at the foot of the
King’s couch a company of apparitions, one of which
seemed to have the pallid, serious, reproving countenance
of Cyrus, the Great King, another the sorrowful face of
Artistone, another the fierce countenance of Bardya,
while a score of others, unknown to him, seemed to come
and go. Their faces were turned towards Cambyses;
but, as the Prince gazed spellbound, the face of Cyrus
turned towards him, his lips seemed to move, and he
seemed to say: “You have kept your oath. You are
free. Ascend the throne of the King of Kings!”</p>

<p>A gurgling shriek from the King aroused the Prince.
The apparitions disappeared. Cambyses was dead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>Belteshazzer said, as the surgeons and attendants,
alarmed by the King’s outcry, rushed into the room:
“The King is dead. Let the body be embalmed for
transportation to Pasargadæ, that he may sleep with
his fathers.”</p>

<p>“Let this order be obeyed,” added the Prince, addressing
the attendants. Then he said to Belteshazzer:
“Come, prophet of God, to my tent. I need your counsel
and aid.”</p>

<p>They left the pavilion and walked slowly to the
Prince’s headquarters. To Gobryas whom they met still
on guard the Prince said: “The King is dead. Let the
men be fed and tell them to rest. Let the news be proclaimed
throughout the camp. Send a company of men
to arrest Prexaspes and bring him before me.”</p>

<p>He passed on with Belteshazzer. Gobryas hastened
to execute his orders. He sent a squad to arrest
Prexaspes, but found that the latter had escaped. The
wily Mede had hastened from the camp during the confusion
incident to the King’s death, and was journeying
northward as fast as his horse could carry him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prince and Belteshazzer sat at meat
in the Prince’s tent and talked of many things. When
the prophet arose to depart, he said: “Have great
care, my son! Those men who brought the news of this
false Bardya’s usurpation are likewise commissioned by
the Magi to slay you. They do not dare openly harm
you, but they will secretly assassinate you if opportunity
offer. But fear not! Within the year you will reign
as King of Kings!”</p>

<p>“Give me your blessing, O Prophet of God!” besought
the Prince. “When I reign, you shall come to
me and be my chief counselor. You shall be at the head
of the college of wise men. Ease and plenty shall be
yours and peace shall come to your people!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“May the blessing of God, the Almighty, the Eternal,
the Ancient of Days, rest upon you!” said Belteshazzer,
solemnly, laying his hands upon the Prince’s bowed head.
“Remember when you come to the throne that Cyrus
promised that my people should return to Jerusalem and
recover their homes and property.”</p>

<p>“I remember, and it shall be done. Let me send
guards with you beyond the camp.”</p>

<p>“It is needless. I shall go as I came, without the
need of guards. Farewell!”</p>

<p>With a smile he disappeared, and the Prince was left
alone, to stand awhile in deep thought and then to pace
back and forth many minutes. Presently he called his
orderlies and directed them to call the chief captains
into council. They soon arrived, and he greeted each
affectionately. When a score of them had assembled,
he said:</p>

<p>“I have called you together to hear the orders made
necessary by the death of Cambyses, King of Kings.
It has become necessary for me to depart at once to
Hamadan. I take with me the Imperial Guard. I
leave Alyates in command of the army. He shall see to
it that the King’s body is properly embalmed. It must
be buried at Pasargadæ with the other Kings. Let the
army march leisurely to Damascus and there halt until
the orders of the new King shall have been received.
Let it be known that this army stands ready to enforce
obedience to the house of Achæmenius.”</p>

<p>Alyates, a tall, soldierly Mede, saluted and said,
“Your orders shall be obeyed, my Lord Prince.”</p>

<p>After other suggestions concerning the movements of
the army, the Prince dismissed the council and sat down
to write letters to his father and to the Princess Athura.
He related what he had heard from Belteshazzer concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
the false Bardya, gave an account of the death
of the King, and stated his own purpose, to march at
once to Hamadan and seize the impostor. He prayed
that his father would declare himself King of Kings and
lead an army of Persians to Hamadan at once. These
letters he entrusted to Gobryas, who, with a dozen trusty
men, at once set out for Persia, riding at courier speed.</p>

<p>At daybreak, the Prince and his ten thousand men,
in light marching order, moved quietly out of the camp
and proceeded to Damascus. Thence, by forced
marches, they moved across the desert towards Babylon,
taking for guides trusty Arab sheiks to whom Belteshazzer
had commended him. Nor could the uneasy
Gaumata and the scheming Patatheites, at Hamadan,
discern his movements and so lay plans to intercept him.
When they heard that he had started for Hamadan at
the head of ten thousand Persians, they made haste to
gather together an army with which to resist him, and
a portion of the army was moved out towards the fords
of the upper Tigris. But the Prince and his guards
came not that way. It was his plan to seize Babylon
and Susa and form a junction with the Persian army
which he knew would march up from Persepolis.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>THE EARLESS KING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">KING HYSTASPIS, ruler of Iran under the shadow
of the King of Kings, walked leisurely through the
park surrounding his palace at Persepolis and meditated
upon the doctrines of Zoroaster. Student and mystic,
loving rather the peace and quiet of his home than the
martial camp or the ruler’s throne, he found his greatest
enjoyment in his beautiful park where he might be
alone. Quiet walks, dreamy hours by running streams
beneath shady trees, communion with the learned and
wise, and meditation on the mysteries of life and of
nature occupied his leisure moments. Delightful indeed
were the October days. Brown and golden were
the leaves where deciduous trees made ready to cast
their burdens. The evergreen of pine and fir interspersed
the more brilliant colors. The sky was hazy
and the sunbeams, softened by shimmering mists, had
lost their great heat and vivid glare.</p>

<p>The King was at ease. No armor burdened him.
A round felt cap with a purple band sat lightly on his
massive head. His long gray hair fell in masses to the
collar of his Medean cloak. His white beard touched
the belt at his waist. The purple cloak, reaching from
shoulder to knee, partially covered in its graceful folds
the dark tunic of his under-dress. His feet were shod
in boots of soft leather. In his hand was a heavy cane,
with which as he walked he flicked pebbles from his
path. A large shepherd dog walked at his side. Master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and dog had enjoyed the park alone for a long time.
But there came an interruption. The dog suddenly
bounded away through the trees towards the palace,
whose massive portico was partially visible through the
foliage. The King stopped to observe the cause of his
follower’s movements and saw a woman coming rapidly
towards him, at sight of whom his countenance shone
with pleasure. It was the Princess Athura. She held
in her hand a roll of papyrus. Following her at respectful
distance was a man in the uniform of a King’s
messenger, whose dusty habit and halting steps told of
a long ride and weariness.</p>

<p>“My brother has written me!” cried the Princess, as
she drew near. “See! I have here a letter from him,
sealed with his own private signet!”</p>

<p>“Which brother mean you?” inquired the King, with
surprise.</p>

<p>“Bardya!”</p>

<p>“Is it so? What says he?”</p>

<p>The old man’s brow was clouded as he spoke. Not
yet had he declared for the new King Bardya, though
he did not suspect as yet the imposture by which the
Magi hoped to retain power. He had called the nobles
of Persia to a council on this matter, and the meeting
would be held shortly. He had loved Bardya almost as
a son and knew that the people hated Cambyses. But
Bardya had not begun his reign by calling back the
Persian nobles to the chief offices, nor had he banished
the Magi—much to the chagrin and sorrow of the King
of Iran. He listened attentively as Athura read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>My beloved sister, Athura, Light of the World and
Queen of the Aryans</i>:</p>

<p>“Now that I have come forth from my place of safety
in the royal mountain, Demavend, and taken upon me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the crown of King of Kings, my heart goes out to you.
Do you not remember how we used to talk of ruling this
great empire of Cyrus together? My brother, Cambyses,
would have killed me and you, could he have done
so. The good priests of Mithra saved me and hid me
away until the time was ripe to come forth. Of this I
will tell you more when I see you.</p>

<p>“I have heard that you are with the royal Hystaspis
at his palace in Persepolis. May peace be with him!
I have sent him greetings by a suitable embassy, confirming
him in all his titles and requesting him to acknowledge
my rule. For Cambyses is dead. The army
near Damascus has revolted from him and slain him.
I know how the royal Hystaspis loves you. Persuade
him, therefore, to assist me in my great task and he shall
be the second man in the empire.</p>

<p>“As for yourself, come to me. I need you here at
Hamadan to advise me. You were ever the wiser and
you shall be joint ruler with me in fact if not in name.
I am sending an escort to meet you at Susa. To that
point, royal Hystapsis will give you suitable escort.</p>

<p>“Come to me. It is a command.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Bardya</span>, King of Kings.”</p>
</div>

<p>She paused and looked inquiringly into the King’s
eyes. The latter took from her hand the scroll and read
it himself in silence. Then he said: “If it be true that
Cambyses is dead, my course is clear. Yet am I not
satisfied. It seems almost inconceivable that Bardya
has come back from the dead. Yet it must be so.”</p>

<p>He beckoned to the messenger, who had discreetly
halted a score of paces distant, and asked, “Are you in
the regular messenger service?”</p>

<p>The man bowed low till his hands touched the earth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
and then, standing in humble attitude, answered, “Yes,
Master.”</p>

<p>“How many years?”</p>

<p>“Ten years, Master.”</p>

<p>“Then you have often seen Cyrus, the Great King?
Also Cambyses and Bardya?”</p>

<p>“Truly have I seen them, my lord, many times. I
know them well.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen King Bardya since he returned to
Hamadan?”</p>

<p>“Twice, but only at the public audiences. He rides
not forth as formerly, because, it is said, he fears assassins.”</p>

<p>“How looks he?”</p>

<p>“The lights were dim when I saw him, but I recognized
him. He has lost flesh, as if he had been ill. He
used to take part in the martial sports, but does not do
so now.”</p>

<p>“What say the people of him?”</p>

<p>“They praise him for the most part. He has remitted
the taxes, pardoned all political offenders, and
proclaimed a year of peace and jubilee. Only the old
priests grumble, who are displeased because he favors
the Magi.”</p>

<p>“You may return to the palace, where you will be
entertained.”</p>

<p>Saluting again, the messenger gladly hastened away
to the ample refreshments he knew awaited him at the
palace. The King returned the scroll to Athura and
sighed. After a moment’s thought, he said: “Daughter,
I like not the situation. If Cambyses be dead, as here
reported, then Bardya is rightfully King. But he has
abandoned the ancient religion of his fathers very suddenly
for the accursed superstition of those Scythian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
interlopers, the Magi. But his decree concerning the
Magi shall not run in Iran! I have heard that some of
the temples of our religion in Medea have been closed
and that the altars of the fire-worshipers on the hilltops
have multiplied. So changed is he in all this that I am
astounded. He commands you to come to him. It is
for you to decide. It may be that you can turn him back
from his evil way. But I fear to let you go.”</p>

<p>“I am greatly troubled,” said Athura. “Bardya
never was inclined to give much thought to religion.
He loves sports, the army, and the hunt. His heart is
easily touched. In gratitude to those who saved his life,
he has granted them great privileges. All the more
should I, on whom he ever leaned for advice, be near him,
to lead him back if possible to the old paths. I have
nothing to fear from him. It is my duty to go. But I
desire your advice. You have been a father to me, and
the gracious Queen, a mother!”</p>

<p>The King smiled. “If my son returns from Egypt,”
he said, “I shall deem myself happy to acknowledge you
my daughter in fact. If Cambyses is dead, there need
be no more concealment or fear. I will send trusty messengers
to Hamadan, Babylon, and Susa and even to
Egypt to learn the truth. My son would certainly have
sent messengers to me with news of the King’s death if
he were dead.”</p>

<p>“May Ahura-Mazda hasten the day of his return!
How long it has been since I last saw him!”</p>

<p>“If you go to Hamadan, what will be the result?
Will Bardya act as did Cambyses?”</p>

<p>“No, a thousand times! Bardya will consent to my
marriage with your son at once.”</p>

<p>“It may be. And yet, knowing how my son loves
the truth and our ancient faith, I fear that Bardya’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
new faith will cause a rupture of their friendship.
Darius is an enemy of liars. Unlike me, this son of
mine loves war rather than peace and has little patience
with those who differ from him in opinion. Perhaps
his love for you will cause him to overlook the errors of
your brother. As to this letter, if you go, my blessing
shall go with you; and, should you call to me for aid
from the ends of the earth, I will march to you at the
head of a hundred thousand Persians. If you stay here,
all Iran will be a bulwark around you and my home shall
be yours.”</p>

<p>Tears filled the eyes of Athura. Kneeling, she placed
the right hand of the King on her head, saying: “I will
take your blessing, my father, and go. Well do I know
the love of our people. Sometimes in the bitterness of
my condition I have thought of calling them to arms and
throwing down from his throne the dread Cambyses.
Had it not been for that oath you and your son swore
to the Great King, I would have done so!”</p>

<p>Hystaspis bent over and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>“May Ahura-Mazda, giver of all life, bless you!” he
said solemnly. “May Sraosha, his powerful messenger,
ever be at your right hand to convey to Him your
slightest petition! May happiness in the love of a husband
be yours and peace in your own home! Come, let
us go to the palace and break the sad news of your going
to the mother there.”</p>

<p>They went to the palace side by side and were met on
the portico by the stately lady who ruled the King’s
heart even as he kept sway over millions of proud subjects.</p>

<p>She sought to persuade Athura not to go to Hamadan,
until more certain information of the conditions there
could be had; but Athura was firm in her determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
to obey the call of her brother. Therefore next day a
company of cavalry escorting the Princess marched towards
Susa. King Hystaspis rode with her a day’s
journey.</p>

<p>On the fifth day after the departure of the Princess,
three of the great Persian nobles, Otanes, Hydarnes, and
Vomisces, resplendent in military dress and in armor
adorned with bright metal and precious stones, each
attended by a score of stout guards, rode over the stone
bridge across the Pulwar and demanded audience of the
King. A chamberlain conducted them into the audience
hall, where the benevolent King sat on his throne
in state. They saluted him, and Otanes said: “O
King, live forever! We, your counselors, come to advise
with you on grave affairs of state.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to behold you,” responded the King.
“You are welcome. Speak on!”</p>

<p>Otanes drew a letter from the folds of his cloak.</p>

<p>“Here have I a letter from my daughter, Phædima,”
he said. “She was the wife of the Great King, Cambyses,
and she was taken as wife by that one who calls
himself Bardya, who, having deposed Cambyses, assumed
to marry all his wives. But listen! Was ever
such fraud practiced upon a people? This came secretly
by a messenger, a slave who owed his life to my
daughter. Let me read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“‘<i>To Otanes, my beloved father</i>:</p>

<p>“‘In much shame and agitation do I write this and
will endeavor to dispatch it to you by Hyrax, my faithful
slave.</p>

<p>“‘This Bardya is an impostor. He is not Bardya
the King’s brother. When Patatheites, the regent, announced
that Bardya, son of Cyrus, had returned from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Mount Demavend where he had been hiding, and had
declared himself King of Kings, there was great rejoicing
in Hamadan, and all the people and the army gladly
declared for him. The new King made a decree divorcing
us from Cambyses and making all of us his wives.
What could we do? It was the King’s word.</p>

<p>“‘But, when this man came to visit me, I saw that he
could not be the true Bardya, though he resembles him
much. He wore a turban after the manner of the
Arabs but in such way that it covered his hair and ears.
This day did I discover that he has no ears. While he
slept, overcome by wine, his turban was disarranged.
Then I remembered that I saw this man led away from
the presence of Cyrus, who had sentenced him to have
his ears cut off for some offense. His name was Gaumata
and he was a wizard, a priest of the Magi. This
is the man! I had no dagger or I would have slain him.
We are prisoners in the palace and are not permitted
to go even to the park walls. Haste, then, my father, to
rescue your daughter from this foul creature! I have
heard it proclaimed that Cambyses is dead, slain by his
own hand in Syria. Of the truth of this I know not.
My hands reach out to you!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“‘Farewell!</span><br />
“‘<span class="smcap">Phædima.</span>’”</p>
</div>

<p>The King was amazed. He arose from his throne as
the reading proceeded and nervously pulled at his beard.
When it was done, he smote together his hands in great
agitation.</p>

<p>“Alas!” he cried. “How unfortunate that your message
did not come five days ago! Then I would have
kept the royal Athura here or marched with her to Hamadan
at the head of an army. Only five days ago in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
obedience to a letter sent her by this false slave, calling
himself Bardya, she departed, and even now she may be
at Susa in his power! May curses rest on him! I perceive
his scheme! With the last of the children of
Cyrus in his power, he thinks to be safe. But not so!
No time is to be lost! Let us take immediate action!”</p>

<p>He pulled a cord near at hand, and a gong sounded
in an adjacent room. Instantly a door at the right of
the throne swung open, admitting an officer of the Guard.
To him the King said: “Captain Arios, take five hundred
men, the best of the army in Persepolis, with the
strongest horses, and ride to Susa! Ride day and night!
Seize horses and supplies as you go! Overtake Captain
Mardux and bring back the Princess Athura, if you
can. Ride even to Hamadan if you do not find her at
Susa. Send messengers in advance to overtake and
turn her back. Spare not horses or men! Delay not!”</p>

<p>The captain, though filled with wonder at this sudden
order, did not pause to ask reasons for it, but bowed
low before his lord and left the room. A moment later
the clatter of horses’ hoofs on the paved court indicated
that he had departed.</p>

<p>The King turned to his counselors and said: “It is
my will that the reserves be called to arms and that all
the regular troops be gathered at Persepolis. We shall
march without delay upon the usurper. Secrecy and
swiftness must be observed. Let us seize the wretch
before he may gather an army to oppose us. What say
you?”</p>

<p>“That is my word!” answered Otanes.</p>

<p>“And mine!” added Hydarnes.</p>

<p>“And mine!” said Vomisces.</p>

<p>“Then let it be done! Let every able-bodied man in
your several districts be called. I will send orders to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
the Governor of Bactra to call out the reserves and to
march to Rhages with the Bactrian troops. He will
bring two hundred thousand men. We should march
from Persepolis with no less. I wish that my son were
here! We shall need him.”</p>

<p>After further consultation as to details, the nobles
departed. Scores of messengers, riding at breakneck
speed, penetrated to distant hamlets and summoned
every man of the military class to Persepolis. Stores of
weapons and provisions were quickly gathered. The
great plain near Persepolis quickly became populous
with men and impedimenta. All Iran was stirred with
the excitement of coming war; but none knew why they
were called, save that it was on the King’s business.</p>

<p>On the tenth day two hundred thousand men stood in
line on the plain near the Araxes for review, and their
gray-bearded King rode along their serried ranks and
saw that they were ready and eager to march. They
saw that the face of the monarch was serious and filled
with anxiety, and they guessed that they were about to
engage in a civil war. The King did not enlighten them.
A messenger had come from Captain Arios at Susa,
stating that he had found Captain Mardux and his
men who had escorted Athura to Susa, but that the
Princess had gone forward towards Hamadan the day
before his arrival. The King was disappointed and
anxious. Having ordered that the march begin next
day, he returned to his palace.</p>

<p>At sundown of that same day, Gobryas and half a
dozen weary troopers arrived in the camp and after
hasty greetings to the generals in command went direct
to the King. The King was on his portico, reclining on
a couch so placed that he could watch the glories of the
setting sun, while near him sat the Queen engaged upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
some needlework. Recognizing Gobryas in spite of his
unshaven and dusty condition, Hystaspis rose with an
exclamation of surprise and went down the steps to meet
and embrace him.</p>

<p>“It rejoices my soul to see you, noble Gobryas!” he
said. “Whence come you? What of my son?”</p>

<p>“Gracious King, I have come from Syria by way of
Babylon and the lower roads,” answered Gobryas.
“Your son was well when I, obedient to his commands,
left him to come hither.”</p>

<p>“Praise be to Ahura-Mazda! What of the King?”</p>

<p>“Cambyses is dead. There is no king other than you,
O King Hystaspis! I greet you King of Kings and
Lord of Lords!”</p>

<p>He bent his knee and kissed the King’s hand. But
Hystaspis raised him up, saying: “Not yet, my son!
The nobles of all Iran must be consulted. We had
heard rumors of the death of Cambyses, but were not
sure.”</p>

<p>“Cambyses is dead. I saw him stab himself before
all the army when messengers came into camp proclaiming
Bardya King. Yea, truly he is dead and the world
is better for it! As for this traitor at Hamadan, I have
come direct from your son to announce that he is not
Bardya but a false usurper. I perceive you have already
learned his true character and are ready to march
against him. I have letters from the Prince. Even
now he is drawing near to Babylon with his ten thousand
men of the Guard.”</p>

<p>He produced a packet from his belt and gave it to the
King.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the King, leading him up on the portico
where the Queen waited. “You shall be refreshed at
my own table and shall stay in our palace this night. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
have much to ask concerning our son and of the war in
Egypt and of the death of the King.”</p>

<p>Gobyras bent low before the Queen, kissed her hands
extended to him in cordial welcome, and said: “Queen
of the World, I give you love and greetings from the
Prince. Daily has he spoken of you. I bear a letter
for you. I have another for the Princess Athura. But,
alas! Otanes has explained to me how she has gone into
the power of that Gaumata!”</p>

<p>The Queen took from Gobyras the packet he handed
to her, and then, placing her hands on his shoulders,
drew him down and kissed both his cheeks, saying:
“My son’s blood-brother is my son! Welcome home!
How weary you are! You shall rest in the Prince’s
own apartment this night.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>THE SPIDER’S WEB</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAPTAIN MARDUX and his troopers felt themselves
highly honored as escorts of the highest born
and most beautiful woman in the world, when they departed
from Persepolis with the Princess Athura.
When she chose to ride a horse, the captain knelt that
she might place one small foot on his knee and thence
leap into the saddle. When she chose to ride in a litter,
the captain had difficulty in choosing from the many
volunteers those who should be carriers. He had to be
severe in denying some the right to stand guard around
her tent as she slept, since all could not do so. These
hard-fisted, hard-riding sons of Persia deemed themselves
guardians of a goddess; and all of them were her
devotees. Her journey was a pleasant pastime.</p>

<p>They arrived at Susa on the sixth day and were met
by the governor of the city with all his chief officials.
They conducted the Princess to the royal palace, where
she rested a day. The city was gayly decorated in her
honor. Then a company of Medean cavalry, under command
of a noble Mede, relieved Captain Mardux and
his men of their charge, and with them the Princess continued
her journey towards Hamadan. From Susa to
Behistun the road was better and the pace more rapid.
On the tenth day they stood beneath the shadow of the
great rock and were about to turn eastward across the
mountains, when a courier met them, bearing a letter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
informing Athura that King Bardya had gone to a castle
in Nicæa on a hunting-trip and asking her to come to
him there. Athura and her escort therefore took a road
leading northerly into Western Medea. Thus it came
about that Captains Arios and Mardux, pushing forward
in desperate haste to rescue the Princess from the
usurper, and supposing that she had gone direct to
Hamadan, missed her by turning to the right at Behistun
two hours after she and her train had disappeared in the
northern hills. Thus it came about also that the Prince
of Iran and his weary ten thousand, having avoided
Babylon on the right and Susa on the left, lest they
should meet with opposition and be delayed, when they
reached the great highway between Persepolis and Susa
and learned that the Princess had gone northward to
Hamadan, delayed not to await the coming of the Persian
army but also turned northward.</p>

<p>Athura’s heart beat high with anticipated pleasure.
A decree had been published in Susa announcing the
death of Cambyses in Syria and the peaceful adherence
of the King’s army to Bardya. Civil war would thus
be averted. Her beloved brother would doubtless call
the Prince of Iran to be his chief counselor, the second
man in the empire. Nothing would hinder her marriage
to him. The future seemed indeed bright with promise.
The Medean escort was attentive and obedient to her
slightest wish. At Nicæa a second message awaited
Athura, informing her that the King was at the castle
of Sictachotes, a score of miles farther north, and bidding
her come there. Here a new escort took charge,
composed of soldiers and priests whose appearance did
not at all please the Princess. She did not hesitate to
go forward, however, but she resolved that she would
persuade her brother to discharge from his service men
who resembled robbers rather than soldiers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>It was late afternoon when they arrived in sight of
the castle or stronghold of the false Bardya. The
castle was an irregular pile of stone buildings on the
summit of a hill, the crater of a long-extinct volcano.
A small lake filled the mouth of the crater and on its
rim the buildings had been constructed. At the foot of
the cone and completely surrounding it was a high stone
wall through which a huge brazen gate gave entrance
and egress. The buildings were low and of rude architecture,
except one tower which rose to a height of fifty
feet and was about thirty feet square.</p>

<p>The Princess wondered that her brother should bring
her to such an uninviting place; but, remembering his
passion for hunting, she had no misgivings. The great
gate swung open to admit her and her escort, and then
it closed with a clang. Having ascended the hill to a
level space in front of the high tower, the escort dismounted
and its leader came to assist Athura to alight.
But she said haughtily to him: “Go, call the King.
Why is he not here to meet me?”</p>

<p>The officer bowed low and went into the castle, whence
he presently returned with a richly dressed official who
forthwith prostrated himself before royalty. “May you
live forever, O gracious lady!” he said loudly. “The
King is out hunting, not expecting you until the morrow.
But all things are ready for you. Be pleased to alight
and enter!”</p>

<p>The Princess then dismounted and followed the official
into the castle. The room they first entered was
in the base of the high tower and occupied its whole
space. It was richly furnished with tables, couches, and
rugs. Draperies concealed the rough walls. Athura
had brought with her three maids. Several others presently
appeared from side-rooms and humbly awaited her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
pleasure. The official, who proved to be the King’s
chamberlain, having called the servants, now said:
“My Lord the King will return shortly. Meanwhile, if
it please you, dinner will be served here. Let the maids
be disposed of in the adjoining room. Should you desire
to take the air, there is a pleasant walk around the
lake. If anything be needed, pull the cord at the side
here and a gong will call servants. Permit me to retire
and order your dinner served.”</p>

<p>The Princess assented and the chamberlain, with a
low salaam, departed. Having bathed, and changed her
riding habit to one more comfortable, she ate dinner
alone. She was grieved and impatient. But she was to
suffer further disappointment. For at sundown a messenger
appeared who reported that a revolt had broken
out in the army at Hamadan, thus compelling the King’s
instant return to that city. He had departed at once,
but promised to return quickly and escort her in person
to the capital. He bade her rest meanwhile at the castle.</p>

<p>Athura was furious. It seemed strange that her
brother should treat her thus. He must be indeed
changed from that former bold youth who would have
let state matters go to ruin rather than fail to come
to her at once when so near! She rang for the chamberlain,
and when that worthy appeared she inquired,
“Was the King here this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, gracious lady,” he replied humbly.</p>

<p>“How did he seem? Was he well?”</p>

<p>“He seemed very well but somewhat nervous.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand his strange behavior! Order
immediate preparations for my departure in the morning
to Hamadan! I shall go to him and ascertain the
cause of this neglect.”</p>

<p>The chamberlain raised his hands in protest. He
shook his head and salaamed humbly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“I have an order from the King, gracious lady,” he
said. “It is that I safely keep you here until he return.”</p>

<p>“What! Am I a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“Ah, no! Say not so! But this is a very unsafe
country,—wolves, bears, robbers, and brigands! It is
not safe for you without a strong escort to go beyond the
castle-walls. The escort which brought you hither has
departed for Nicæa again, and only the necessary garrison
is here. Very sorrowful am I, most gracious lady,
but I dare not disobey orders. The King, I assure you,
will come soon.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” exclaimed Athura, furiously. “I care
nothing for the safety of this castle! I order you to
prepare this garrison to march with me to Hamadan on
the morrow. I will answer to the King for you and
no harm shall come to you. Let the castle take care of
itself!”</p>

<p>But the chamberlain again shook his head and wrung
his hands together in simulated agitation. “Impossible,
utterly impossible! The King’s orders must be obeyed.
You know not this King, gracious lady! He is a magician
who can destroy one, soul and body. No, no!”</p>

<p>“A magician! What mean you? My brother Bardya
a magician? Since when gained he that power?”</p>

<p>But the chamberlain, seeing that he had almost revealed
his master’s real identity, shook his head and continued
to wring his hands, protesting: “I meant only
that the King’s eyes were upon all and over all! But I
cannot disobey him, and—I will not!”</p>

<p>He abruptly turned and left the room. Athura went
to one of the narrow windows and looked tearfully out
upon the yellow landscape of hill and mountain, on
which the setting sun was casting its last mellow beams.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Her eyes ran over the courtyard, the steep descent of
hill, the high wall below with its brazen gate and its
sentries, posted at intervals on the top. A great loneliness
seized upon her, a cold dread of impending evil
gripped her heart, and a terror of unknown forces that
seemed to surround her. Turning from the window, she
met the eyes of one of the maids compassionately watching
her. The expression of her face caught Athura’s
attention. Repressing her tears lest the servants should
deem her weak, she addressed the maid:</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Lauretha, gracious mistress,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Who are you and whence come you?”</p>

<p>“I am a daughter of the captain of the guard, and I
came from Nicæa hither.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, whose is this castle and how came my
brother here? He has been acting most unbrotherly to
me. Have you a brother whom you love most dearly?
And would he call you to a place like this and then not
meet you, or run away to the city without visiting you?”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes filled with tears. The beauty and engaging
personality of Athura had already made a deep
impression upon her. She had heard in the old days of
this beautiful daughter of Cyrus as a very goddess of
wisdom and beauty. Now that she beheld her, she was
her devotee. She drew nearer and, kneeling, caught
hold of the hem of Athura’s dress and kissed it.</p>

<p>“Gracious Queen of the World, I am but a humble
girl,” she said, sobbing: “My parentage is not even
noble. But I place my soul and body at your service!
Let me make confession to you and I will trust in your
forgiveness for my enforced service here. If you will
follow me to the chamber above, where you are to sleep
and where we may be alone, I will tell you the secret of
your situation.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Arise and be assured of my good-will. I will follow
you,” answered the Princess, touched by the girl’s
devotion and wondering what she meant.</p>

<p>The girl rose and, going to a curtained door at one
side of the room, pulled aside the curtain and guided
the Princess up a narrow stairway, in the thick stone
wall, to a chamber above and of the same size and as
richly furnished as that below. Here the Princess seated
herself on a divan and the girl again knelt at her feet on
the floor.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you mean,” said Athura, kindly.</p>

<p>“I know the man who calls himself Bardya. He
owns this castle,” said the girl, speaking rapidly. “I
also have seen your brothers, both the great Cambyses,
the King, and the strong, happy Prince Bardya. That
was years ago when I lived in Hamadan and my father
was a soldier of the palace-guard under the noble Otanes.
I also know the regent, Patatheites, whom Cambyses,
the Great King, left to rule in Medea. O gracious lady,
it breaks my heart to tell you! But I know that Bardya,
your brother, is dead and this one who calls himself
Bardya is none other than Gaumata, priest of the Magi,
whose ears Cyrus, the Great King, cut off! I have seen
Gaumata and Patatheites together. I know that Gaumata
pretends to be Bardya. The chamberlain is one
of his tribe. This great tower is a fire-worshiper’s
shrine and on its top is an altar on which fire is kept
burning. I know not why I tell you this, except that
when I look upon your face I love and worship you.
O that I might save you! I fear this prison is intended
to be your tomb!”</p>

<p>Athura sat very still during this revelation. Her
head seemed to reel. The earth and all her golden castles
seemed whirling and falling. Of course Bardya<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
would have come to meet her! She knew the girl was
telling the truth. Fool, to be so easily beguiled!
Bardya really dead! The old sorrow resurged in her
soul. Death or worse her fate! She sat still and silent
a long time in wide-eyed despair while the maid at her
feet with bowed head wept bitterly. Presently she
sighed deeply and asked, “Why do you weep, little sister?”</p>

<p>“Because of your cruel fate, gracious lady,” replied
the maid. “You know not the magic power of these
priests! Even now they may know that I have told
this to you and even now they may be preparing the torture
chamber for me. They are terrible men! They
deal with the demons of the hills and mountains.
They sacrifice to them, even offering up human lives
sometimes. They are able to read one’s thoughts.
They bring up the dead and make them talk. Only
Ahura-Mazda can protect you, and I know not if He
will!”</p>

<p>“Be comforted, child,” said Athura, calmly. “Let us
escape in some manner. Once before I fled from a
prison when Cambyses would have slain me. Is there
no way of escape?”</p>

<p>“I know of none. These walls have secret doors. I
have seen Gaumata appear in these rooms even without
opening a door. But he is a magician. I do not know
the secret doors. If we could escape from this castle,
the great wall and its watch is there.”</p>

<p>“You said that your father is captain of the guard.
Might he not assist us?”</p>

<p>“I know not. He fears the Magi. His father was a
tenant of this Gaumata who, for his faithfulness, has
promised him great fortune and a high command. But
he is a brave man and a good father.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“Such a man must have a good heart. We shall talk
with him presently.”</p>

<p>“But these magicians,—is it not useless to strive
against them? They look one in the eye and point
their fingers and say, ‘You are a dog! Bark!’ And
that one gets down on his hands and acts like a dog and
barks. Or they will say to you that at a certain hour
you must do something they order; and, at that hour,
you must do it! They put spells on men, and such men
thereafter have no power. Oh, it is dreadful, how at
night they call up and talk with the dead. The evil
spirits help them.”</p>

<p>“I have seen their spell-working, child. But this I
know, as the great teacher, Belteshazzer, said, they can
do no harm to those who love truth and serve the true
and only God. For He sends mighty spirits of good intent
who encamp about the good and who drive away the
evil ones. Fear not, child, I dread not this Gaumata
and all his evil powers. He shall not harm us. When
does your father have liberty so that he might come
to us?”</p>

<p>“At sundown he changes the guard. Thereafter he
may come.”</p>

<p>The girl went to a window and looked down into the
court below. She then clapped her hands softly and motioned
to some one below.</p>

<p>“Ah, there he stands now!” she said. “He has
looked up and will come here. I will meet him.”</p>

<p>She ran down the narrow stair, and presently her voice
and the heavier tones of a man’s voice were heard in
conversation. Athura seated herself on a divan in such
position that the rays of the setting sun, passing through
the open window, rested upon her face and hair, giving
to her regal beauty a halo like that of a goddess. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
moment later the maid reappeared, followed by a powerfully
built man whose helmet and breastplate were resplendent
in gold and jewels. His face was strong and
bold, the countenance of one accustomed to command,
but now it was clouded and sullen.</p>

<p>“This is my father, Gustasp, gracious mistress,” said
the maid, presenting him.</p>

<p>The man looked an instant into the eyes of the Princess.
Then his hand quickly removed his helmet.
Wonder, admiration, recognition, and awe expressed
themselves in his countenance. He prostrated himself
at her feet. He had known the kingly Cyrus and the
high glance of his eye, before which the most rebellious
of men had quailed; and here was the image of Cyrus,
softened and beautified in the feminine, but, none the
less, with his lofty, commanding spirit, gazing upon him
from eyes whose glance he could not return.</p>

<p>“Hail, gracious daughter of Cyrus!” he mumbled,
striking the rug-covered floor with his forehead. “I
await your commands!”</p>

<p>“I have seen you before, Captain Gustasp, when my
father lived and Bardya, my brother, and I played in
the park at Hamadan. Is it not so? Arise and answer!”</p>

<p>The soldier rose and stood in deferential attitude before
his fair interlocutor.</p>

<p>“I remember, most royal lady,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“If I mistake not I rode on that broad back of yours,
and you made for me a right-spirited horse.”</p>

<p>The strong features of the soldier quivered as memory
brought back those days, when he, as one of the guards
on duty at the King’s palace, not only watched over the
safety of the children of the King but played with them.
Halcyon days! The tears started to his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“I remember,” he answered.</p>

<p>“And now I am your prisoner!”</p>

<p>Again the man fell with his face to the floor. “Say
not so, Queen of the World!” he exclaimed. “Rather
am I your humble slave. If you will let me speak, I
will explain.”</p>

<p>“Say on!”</p>

<p>He raised his head from the floor but continued to
kneel, while he spoke rapidly: “After I returned from
the funeral of the royal Cyrus, I was not in favor with
the Great King, Cambyses. His dislike for me arose
when he and your royal brother, Bardya, and you,
played together as children and, by the express order
of good King Cyrus, I watched that Cambyses did not
use violence upon you and the younger brother. He
swore, then, that when he came to man’s estate I should
die. When, therefore, the guards were called to Hamadan
and dismissed by him, I fled; and, luckily, I escaped
before his order for my execution could be fulfilled.
I came to these mountains and was concealed by the
Magian priests who had been friends of my father.
Then I heard, gracious lady, that both you and Prince
Bardya had been foully murdered by King Cambyses;
and I wept much. For I loved you and Bardya when
you were children. For me the light of the world grew
dim. Wonder not, therefore, that I willingly served
Gaumata when he overthrew Cambyses. Had not Cambyses
slain those I loved and also sought to slay me? I
did not know you when you entered here yesterday.
You were veiled. My information was that the King’s
wife was coming hither; and I dreamed not that you
were she. May Ahriman wither my soul if I speak not
the truth!”</p>

<p>His daughter sank upon the floor by her father’s side,
exclaiming, “Truly he speaks truth, gracious mistress!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>A wave of sympathy swept over the beautiful countenance
of the Princess. Impulsively she arose, bent
over, and touched the man’s forehead with her hand,
saying: “I believe you, my good Gustasp. Ah, those
were pleasant days, the days of my childhood. But
they have gone to return no more. The bloody hand of
death has taken my father and brothers. Only I, of all
the royal house of Cyrus, remain; and I am a prisoner to
this man, Gaumata. But what now? To whom, O
Gustasp, do you owe allegiance?”</p>

<p>The man did not hesitate. “There is only one sovereign
on earth for me, the divine daughter of Cyrus!”
he answered passionately. “Had I not believed you
dead, I would never have entered the service of Gaumata.”</p>

<p>“I am in your hands. What do you advise?”</p>

<p>“You are safe in my hands, gracious Queen! I will
guard you with my life. But I am slow of wit and not
good at making plans. I can execute orders but not
make them.”</p>

<p>Athura smiled upon the kneeling giant.</p>

<p>“You may arise and be seated there near the door,”
she said. “Let us think of some plan. How many men
have you in this castle?”</p>

<p>Gustasp rose and sat on a stool near the door.</p>

<p>“Four hundred and twenty,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Are they trustworthy?”</p>

<p>“Not against Gaumata. They are his personal followers.
But they are a brave and reckless lot. Some
of them have been brigands all their lives, until called
hither by the new King’s order.”</p>

<p>“It is apparent to you, Captain Gustasp, that I am
no friend of this Gaumata. I have been brought here
by lying letters purporting to be from my brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Bardya, and I knew not the truth until your daughter
revealed it to me. Doubtless I have been brought here
to suffer death. For, as long as one of the house of
Cyrus remain, so long will the usurper be insecure on
his throne. I remember Gaumata. I saw him during
the last year of Cyrus and I heard of his punishment.
Now has come his revenge! But I shall escape. There
is one who comes from the west as swiftly as horses
may bring him. Do you remember the youth who
played with us in those days? That grave youth who
was a man even before he was old enough to enlist in
the King’s guards—Darius, son of Hystaspis, King of
Iran?”</p>

<p>“I remember him. Has not his fame filled the whole
earth? All young Aryans swear by him!”</p>

<p>“True! Had not Cambyses cruelly interfered, I
would this day be his wife. He took an oath to Cyrus,
my father, to support Cambyses and Bardya on their
thrones, as long as they should live. Death has released
him from the oath. It may not be that I shall reign
alone as Queen, since it is contrary to the customs of
the Aryans. The King of Iran is now the head of the
Achæmenian royal family and entitled to reign as King
of the Aryans. When he shall pass the bridge to heaven,
the Prince of Iran will be King. The world will then
know a just and mighty master. And I shall reign with
him. Then, Gustasp, I may be able to reward faithful
service. Is it not possible for me to escape? I escaped
from Cambyses alone, disguised as a youth. Have you
not a horse that I might ride away upon this night?”</p>

<p>Gustasp was troubled. He gazed thoughtfully out of
the window a moment in silence. The red rim of the
sun was disappearing behind a distant ridge.</p>

<p>“This is a wild portion of Medea,” he said presently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
“Brigands roam about. Traveling without a large escort
is dangerous. It is now almost night. For a week
there can be no danger to you here. I am in command
of the Guard. It will not be so much a prison for you
as a place of safety. To-morrow I will send to the
hills for one who owes his life to me. I saved him
from the wrath of Gaumata, who had ordered me to
execute him. This man will I send with a message to
your friends. He may bring help. The chamberlain
of the castle is a priest of the Magi. He was in the
room below as we came through. He is here as your
guard, I suppose. But this night I shall sleep at the
foot of this stairway and keep watch over you. You
are weary and must have sleep. My daughter, if you
will, shall watch with me. Perhaps to-morrow we may
think of a better plan.”</p>

<p>Athura rose and went to the window, where she stood
some moments in silence, contemplating the forbidding
aspect of the darkening hills and considering the words
of the captain. She was, indeed, weary. She therefore
signified her assent to the suggestion, and the captain
retired. His daughter remained with the Princess.
The captain that night slept on the floor of the room
below, with his body across the doorway leading to the
chamber above and his sword at his side.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>A GALLOPING TO AND FRO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE dull, plodding peasants of Persia, Medea, Susiana,
and Babylonia wondered why so many messengers
rode at breakneck speed, on foaming, dusty
horses, and so many squads of cavalry galloped, along
the roads, during those last days of the false Smerdis,
or Bardya, King of the World. They loved not these
military men, with their over-bearing ways, their oaths
and blows, their lawlessness and oppression. But they
only sighed and remained silent, hoping but not believing
that some day the Great King would lift them up
and put the soldiers down. The shepherds on the hills
drove their flocks high up into the mountain fastnesses
and concealed them in gulches and ravines. For, it was
whispered, an immense army of Persians was marching
up from the south. No one knew why it was coming,
but it was safer to keep the flocks out of sight, lest
the hungry hordes should have fresh meat at their expense.
Rumors of war flew about. Some said Babylonia
was about to revolt; others that the Scythians were
threatening an invasion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the capital city, Hamadan, confusion
reigned. Reports came from Persia indicating that the
King of Iran was gathering a great army. Then came
messengers from the army at Damascus relating the departure
of the Prince and the Guard. Patatheites and
Gaumata at once became uneasy and directed the governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
of Nineveh to march out and intercept the Prince.
Then came Prexaspes, who, knowing that he could expect
no mercy from the King of Iran and his son,
offered his services to the usurper, and was made commander
of the army and satrap of Medea. He advised
immediate preparation for war. Decrees were issued
to all the governors of provinces commanding them to
assemble their soldiers and bring them to Hamadan.
Heralds were dispatched to the King of Iran demanding
the reason for gathering an army at Persepolis.
Prexaspes personally went into western Medea, where
he had large estates, and directed that all Medean levies
from that section should gather at Nicæa. Then Gaumata
and Patatheites, learning that their ruse whereby
Athura had been beguiled into the castle of the former,
had succeeded, departed from the capital city to visit
her and make some treaty with, or disposal of, her.
They had barely departed when Captains Arios and
Mardux at the head of their combined companies rode
into the capital on horses almost dead with fatigue,
and at the palace gates demanded the person of the
Princess Athura. The commander of the palace-guard
was insolent and insulting. He even threatened to arrest
the blustering captains, who thereupon suddenly assaulted
the palace with their bold troopers, before the
guards could be warned, and gained possession of it.
The guards fled into the city and called upon the citizens
for aid. Captains Arios and Mardux searched the
palace in vain for the Princess Athura, but found and
released the usurper’s harem, in which was Phædima,
the daughter of Otanes. What next to do the captains
knew not. But the citizens of Hamadan, indignant that
a company of freebooters should dare to take the King’s
palace, soon gave them something to do and laid close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
siege to them in it. They were not to be dislodged, however,
and held the citizens at bay, trusting that they
would presently be rescued by the King of Iran.</p>

<p>The Prince of Iran, having marched by a short route
across northern Arabia, avoided Babylon on the right
and Susa on the left and arrived upon the great highway
between Persepolis and the latter city, where, as
narrated, he received information that led him to march
at once to Susa, intent upon aiding in the rescue of
the Princess Athura. He seized Susa and deposed its
governor, who was a Mede in the service of Gaumata.
He paused here two days to rest and refit his command,
meanwhile sending scouts northward to gain information
concerning the movements of the usurper. Then a body
of Persians, constituting the advance corps of the Persian
army, having arrived, the Prince left a garrison in
the city and with about twenty thousand men hurried
northward on the road to Hamadan, intent upon capturing
that city before Gaumata could prepare for resistance.
On the first day out he was met by the messenger from
Athura, which caused him to change his intention and
march into western Medea upon Nicæa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Princess Athura remained in the castle.
The messenger had been duly dispatched by Captain
Gustasp, who advised his fair captive to wait patiently
several days for his return or until he himself could communicate
with certain relatives who might consent to
conceal her in the mountains should it become necessary
to leave the castle. Then one day a company of cavalry
rode into the castle-yard and its commander, Captain
Galutha, displayed an order giving him chief command.
The next day a large body of cavalry appeared on the
plain below the castle and encamped, while several of
their leaders came up to the castle. Two of these, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
whom all others bowed to the earth, were Gaumata, the
usurper, and his chief counselor, Patatheites. The
Princess Athura observed these men with dread. She
recognized them and knew that a crisis in her affairs had
come. Later came Captain Gustasp in much agitation.</p>

<p>“Gracious lady,” he said, “Gaumata has come! He
desires audience with you. If he attempt any harm
to you, I will slay him! So fear not. I am at your service.
Shall I slay him at once?”</p>

<p>“No. Let him enter,” she answered, seating herself
on a divan at the side of the chamber opposite the window,
where the light was good and where every expression
of her countenance might be seen. She was calm
and self-possessed.</p>

<p>The captain’s daughter stood at her side, trembling
and apprehensive.</p>

<p>A moment later the door opened and the chamberlain
appeared, announcing: “Our Lord, the King, the Great
King, King of the World, and his illustrious Counselor!”</p>

<p>Entered then Patatheites, with somewhat shuffling gait
and embarrassed demeanor, a tall man whose rich habiliments
and mitered head-dress indicated his priestly rank.
He bowed very low and touched the floor with his hands,
saying: “All hail, most beautiful Princess, Daughter of
Cyrus, the Great King, Light of the World! Live forever!”</p>

<p>Following him came Gaumata, a tall man, with uncertain,
shifting eyes, a pallid face, somewhat resembling
the dead Bardya, a puppet evidently in the hands of the
real ruler, Patatheites. He was about to prostrate himself
before royalty, as was his habit, when, remembering
his high position, he checked himself and stood erect,
folding his arms in much embarrassment and agitation.
On his head was a vari-colored turban, around which
was a golden coronet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“I give you greeting. What would you?” responded
Athura, coldly.</p>

<p>Patatheites coughed slightly and glanced at the King;
then, assuming a very ingratiating tone and manner, he
said:</p>

<p>“The fates—I should say, the gods—have ordered
that this man shall be King. It matters not whether he
be truly Bardya or not,—the spirit of Bardya is in him.
It has come to pass that King Cambyses by his own
hand is dead. You alone, royal lady, remain of his
family. By right of birth you should be Queen of the
World. Unless you so rule, the kingdom will pass to the
King of Iran. It has been announced to all the world
that this Bardya has taken to himself all the wives of
Cambyses. That is true, and you yourself are included.
We come, therefore, to make a treaty. Consent to a
marriage with this King, Bardya, and rule equally with
him. Your presence with him will reconcile all Iran
and the world will remain at peace. You cannot rule
alone. He offers to share the throne with you. Let
him speak for himself. I, his Chief Counselor, have
spoken!”</p>

<p>Gaumata, thus prompted, bowed low before her and
said in high, squeaky tones: “Years ago my eyes beheld
the most lovely vision of all the earth. It was
Athura, star of the morning, lovelier than the moon,
shining on a darkened world. My soul went out to her.
I said that I would one day sit on the throne of the world
with her and her slightest wish should be my law, her
will my will, and that together we would rule the universe
wisely. Let it be so!”</p>

<p>Athura restrained her indignation with great difficulty.
Should she temporize, or at once declare herself? She
remained silent a moment. When she spoke, her steady
voice betrayed not her deep agitation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“For this, then, I have been deceived and brought
hither,” she said. “It is a very grave matter. I require
time to consider it. I know there is but one other choice.
That is—death! I must choose between you and
death, unless something intervenes. Such presumption
as yours in the days of Cyrus would have merited death.
But truly has the situation changed through the wisdom
of God. How many days may I have to consider this?”</p>

<p>The men glanced at each other doubtfully. Then the
Counselor spoke.</p>

<p>“Grave events call for quick action. However, if
to-morrow at this time will suit you to answer, let it be
so.”</p>

<p>“I shall require at least a week.”</p>

<p>“No, no! You must decide by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Must?”</p>

<p>Her tone startled the men. In it were unutterable
scorn and menace. Gaumata shrank back. As she
looked now, so had he seen Cyrus and Cambyses, the
terrible. But Patatheites was unafraid and, knowing
the necessity of quick action, he was determined that
her choice should be made at once.</p>

<p>“Forgive the expression,” he said. “We are desperate
men. So stirred up are the people that we must
act quickly. You said truly that you must choose either
to consent or to meet death. Rule the world or die!
Do you hear? But you shall consent!” He gazed
into her eyes with his flashing black eyes fixedly and
extended his long, slender fingers towards her slowly.
He trusted to his great hypnotic power to overcome
the powerful will that showed in her eyes. “On the
morrow at this hour you shall say yes!” he added after
a pause.</p>

<p>Athura smiled derisively. Her eyes showed no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
will-power than his, and, extending her hand in a repellent
gesture, she said: “I say that I will speak freely
without being coerced by your devil’s power! Dog that
you are! I shall live to see your carcass thrown to the
vultures!”</p>

<p>The battle of wills continued in silence for a tense
moment. Then the eyes of Patatheites wavered and
dropped. His hand fell at his side. His dusky face
paled to a sickly yellow.</p>

<p>“Princess, again I ask forgiveness,” he said humbly.
“Well I know that the spirit of the great Cyrus, living
again in you, cannot be commanded! Let us reason together.
Being a woman, you can never reign alone on
the throne of Iran, or of the world. All the males of
your family are dead. The kingdom will pass to the
King of Iran. If his son were living he would make you
his wife, and thus, when his father dies, you might become
his Queen but not a joint ruler with him. But the
Prince of Iran is dead. He was slain in a battle near
Susa yesterday. It remains only for you to accept
our proposition and you will become joint ruler with
this Bardya and reign over the whole world.”</p>

<p>The Princess made no immediate answer, but gazed in
silence on the face of the speaker, striving to read
whether he lied or not in speaking of the Prince. The
cold hand of fear clutched at her heart. Dread seized
her throat and almost stifled her. But there seemed to
whisper in her ear a voice like that of the loved Bardya
of old, saying: “Believe him not, little sister. The
Prince yet lives and will surely come to your aid.” She
was startled and looked around involuntarily searching
for the speaker; but no one, save her maid, was near.
Arousing herself with a great effort, the Princess again
controlled her agitation and said: “You are stating a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
falsehood, magician! But, even if the Prince were dead,
it would not alter my determination. What? I, a
daughter of Cyrus, mate with that slave? Begone from
my sight!”</p>

<p>The pallid face of Gaumata flushed in anger. Thrusting
aside Patatheites, he laid one hand on a short sword
at his side. “Woman!” he cried excitedly, “birth
makes not a man, but achievement! I am a noble of
Medea, of ancient lineage and royal stock. Centuries
ago my forefathers ruled the Scythians, who were once
lords of Medea. I have dared to seize the throne of the
world from your tyrant brother, and I mean to hold it!
I have offered you the right to share it. Choose! On
the morrow you accept or die! The world is not large
enough to permit you and me to live therein unless we
join fortunes!”</p>

<p>The Princess was surprised. She had deemed this
man a mere puppet. He seemed to have some qualities
of a strong man. She spoke less bitterly as she
answered: “You speak somewhat kingly, Gaumata!
But you are a living lie, ruling not by your own might!
You rule only by reason of Bardya’s name. Do not
deceive yourself into the belief that the Aryans would
permit you to rule an hour, did they know the truth!
No! Rather it would be better for you to release me
and place in my hands the scepter and crown. I might
so far pardon you as to permit you life and property.
Think of this, my offer until to-morrow, and I will consider
yours.”</p>

<p>“Until to-morrow then, farewell!” said Patatheites,
bowing low and backing quickly from the room. Gaumata
followed without the formality of a bow. Athura
sat a long time in silence after they had gone, wrapped
in thought, while the daughter of Gustasp stood in
silence with folded hands and bowed head at her side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>The Princess turned to her maid at length and asked:
“What think you, child? The magicians were not able
to bend my will, though strong was the power of the
priest’s evil eyes. I felt my brain reel and I became
dizzy for a moment.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen one able to resist him before,”
answered the maid. “Truly Ahura-Mazda has sent to
your aid some powerful angel!”</p>

<p>The hours of that day passed very slowly for the Princess.
She spent the greater part of her time in the
upper chamber looking from the window upon the valley
below. She had little hope that any aid would arrive.
She was determined to escape from the castle at all
hazards as soon as night should come, and she sent word
to Gustasp that he must arrange for her escape.</p>

<p>About noon two horsemen were seen riding at headlong
speed from the direction of Nicæa. They came
direct to the castle. They evidently bore exciting news.
For the King and his Chief Counselor were observed in
excited conference with them, and, shortly afterwards,
the King mounted a horse and rode down into the valley,
where his cavalry immediately marched away across the
plain towards Nicæa, and several horsemen rode away
in divers directions. Later the King returned to the
castle accompanied by an officer, whose elegantly attired
form and easy carriage, as he passed across the castle-yard,
seemed familiar to Athura. She sent the maid to
call Gustasp, whose duties now consisted in standing
guard at the castle-door. The captain soon appeared.</p>

<p>“What means this excitement?” she inquired.
“Who is the officer that came up with the King?”</p>

<p>Gustasp shrugged his giant shoulders. “The officer
is Prexaspes,” he answered. “He was chief man of the
empire under King Cambyses. He is in command of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
the Medean army which is assembling down there in the
valley. I do not know just what news the messengers
brought; but it is rumored that they reported a strong
force of Persian cavalry moving up towards Nicæa over
the hill-roads from Susa. If that be true, a battle may
occur if the Medes dare to stand against them. There
are but a few veterans here and they may not risk a
battle. The Persian cavalry is terrible, especially if led
by the Prince.”</p>

<p>Athura started up with joy, exclaiming, “By the
Prince, did you say?”</p>

<p>“The Prince of Iran, yes,” he assented. “No one
knows, but I will bet my shield that he leads the Persians!”</p>

<p>“Ahura-Mazda grant that it be true! What of you
if there be a battle, Gustasp? Ought I to wait till the
morrow? Or should I escape this night and trust myself
to the mountains?”</p>

<p>“I have requested the honor of personally guarding
you so that you may not escape,” he responded. “The
King has granted my request. I do not know how to
advise. The new men who came in with Captain Galutha
are on guard. There is to be an enchantment, a
sacrifice, and soma-drinking to-night. Ahura-Mazda
grant that no spell be cast on us! Let me advise that
you stay in this upper chamber with all your maids. I
shall stand here at the foot of the stairs. We may need
a barricade. That divan and the benches may do.
When darkness comes, I will bring up javelins and
spears. I do not know how to get out of the castle with
you unseen.”</p>

<p>“What do you fear?”</p>

<p>“Madmen, drunken with soma! You and the maids
are the only women in the castle. Even the King himself
will be drunken and furious.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“Bring up the arms, Gustasp! You will find in me
no weeping, fainting child. We will fight this battle together!”</p>

<p>“Then on the morrow we may need to defend this
place until the battle be decided down there in the valley.”
And he added fervently, “It will be a joy to fight for
you, O Queen of the Earth, and even to die for you!”</p>

<p>Gustasp began immediate preparations for defense and
secretly brought up a bundle of keen javelins, several
heavy spears, and a huge bronze battle-ax, which they
concealed behind curtains and furniture. He also
brought a supply of bread and fruit.</p>

<p>From her window Athura saw that preparations were
being made in the courtyard for the sacrifice spoken of
by Gustasp. First, a square altar of stones was erected.
Around this, at a distance of twenty feet, a circle of flat
stones was placed. A priest clothed in long robes then
drew geometrical figures with a sword-point on the
ground within the circle. Other priests brought out
twenty tall jars of soma and placed them at intervals
touching the circle. Still others brought wood and piled
it in four heaps at the corners of a square inclosing
the circle. Many soldiers of the garrison gathered
around, uneasily and fearfully watching the preparations,
but they were not allowed to come within twenty paces
of the circle.</p>

<p>The preparations were completed when the sun was
yet half an hour high. Then the rumble and boom of
drums and the shrill scream of trumpets announced the
beginning of the services. A procession of priests,
twenty in number, headed by Patatheites and followed
by Gaumata, who led a beautiful white stallion, appeared
from the northern portion of the castle-yard. Seven
times they silently marched around on the outer side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
the circle of stones. Then they halted and a priest took
station at each of the jars of soma. Every one held a
large, keen knife in one hand and a goblet in the other.
The chief priest, Patatheites, took station at the right
of the altar and raised his hand toward the setting sun in
prayer. All the others imitated his action. Their invocation
was silent and lasted a full minute. Then
Patatheites placed a bundle of fagots on the altar and
again raised his hands to the sun, and his lips moved
in recital of an invocation. Instantly a spiral of smoke
ascended from the fagots and a flame burst forth. The
soldiers, stricken with awe, fell on their knees at sight
of this miracle. The sun-god had answered, unless the
dexterous priest, having a knowledge of phosphorus and
sulphur, had ignited the wood as he placed it on the altar.</p>

<p>Gaumata now led the white stallion into the charmed
circle near to the high priest. The beautiful animal
trembled and sniffed at the altar and the blazing wood,
then raised his noble head and whinnied. As he did so,
the chief priest, with a powerful slash of his sharp knife,
cut the animal’s throat so deeply across as almost to
sever the head. At the same moment, Gaumata drove
his knife deep into the horse’s chest through his proud
heart. With a convulsive backward movement, the
noble beast sought to break away, but Gaumata clung to
it and its knees gave away suddenly and it fell. The
chief priest took a stone vessel and caught the blood
spouting from the severed throat. When the vessel was
filled, he presented it to Gaumata, who lifted it on high
before the fire and towards the setting sun, then poured
some of the blood on the altar and some on the earth
while he muttered a prayer. The chief priest then took
a bundle of rods, known as the baresma, and, dipping it
in the blood, sprinkled the King and the twenty priests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
chanting a hymn as he slowly performed his labor.
Then four of the priests attacked the carcass of the horse
with their knives and rapidly dismembered it. A portion
of flesh from the chest was taken by the King and
placed on the burning wood of the altar. The savor of
it went up to heaven just as the rim of the sun disappeared
behind the western hills, while the priests broke
forth into a barbaric chant in praise of Mithra. The
limbs and body of the animal were then cut in bits and
distributed by the priests to the soldiers. The piles of
wood were set on fire by coals from the altar, and the
men roasted the horseflesh at these and ate of it. Thus
far the ceremony had been conducted with some decorum.</p>

<p>Then the bloody-handed priests dipped goblets into the
jars and brought them forth filled to the brim with a
white, acid liquor, the sacred juice of the soma plant.
First, the chief priest drank a huge goblet of the liquor.
The King followed suit. Then the priests drank, and
as they drank they began a serpentine march, following
the lines of the geometrical figures drawn in the circle,
weaving in and out and crossing back and forth, chanting
in time to their movements. The chief priest led
the weird dance. The King followed at the rear. Ever
and anon, as their movements brought them near the
jars, the priests replenished their goblets. Gradually
their chant became louder and wilder, and was addressed
to the gods of the sun, of the moon, of the stars, of the
earth, and of the seas, entreating them to be present and
to give counsel and wisdom to the King.</p>

<p>Darkness fell upon the earth, but the fires partially
dispelled the gloom in the courtyard. The crowd of
soldiers drew well back from the enchanted circle, dreading
they knew not what, and fearing the unknown powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
of earth and sky. Suddenly one of the priests ceased
marching and, with a scream, rent the clothes from his
body. Stark naked he began to dance furiously, leaping
in the air, frothing at the mouth, and uttering wild words
of prophecy. Another imitated him and still another,
until a score of naked, leaping, shouting madmen, brandishing
knives and soma-pots, encircled the chief priest,
who, having drunk but little of the powerful liquor, had
remained comparatively sober, and who now took his
station with folded arms and bowed head before the
altar, listening intently to the ravings of his helpers.
The King took his place on the opposite side of the
altar and sought to preserve a semblance of dignity, but
he swayed to and fro under the influence of the liquor
or of excitement while he also listened to the ravings of
the prophets.</p>

<p>The Princess and her maids were curious observers
of the ceremonies, but their curiosity turned to horror as
the last act of the drunken priests began. Nevertheless,
they watched and listened.</p>

<p>One of the priests, bellowing for silence, stood before
the chief priest and shouted: “I am Melchior of the
Hills! Say to this King, he lacks courage! Say to him
that instead of entreating the proud woman in yonder
castle, he should take her by force, lest there come an
eagle out of the south and carry her away! Let him
now act! Now! Now! Now!”</p>

<p>Another shouted: “I am sent from Mithra to say,
The day comes when the Kings of the earth shall meet
in death struggle! To him of stout heart and quick
mind will the victory be! Up and act!”</p>

<p>Others took up the burden of prophecy and warning.
The chief priest listened attentively; then, calling the
King aside, he spoke rapidly and earnestly to him, pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
up to the window from which the Princess was looking
down upon them. For a time the King hesitated,
then walked uncertainly towards the castle, followed by
the howling mob of priests, who stumbled, rolled, or
hopped after him. A moment later they were hammering
at the castle-door and the King was commanding
Gustasp to open.</p>

<p>Gustasp, however, had not been idle. He had locked
and barred the stout doors and had reinforced them with
furniture piled against them. Now, as the King’s voice
was heard commanding him to open, he shouted back a
refusal.</p>

<p>“Open, I command it!” shouted the King.</p>

<p>“I will never open it!” answered Gustasp. “No
longer do I serve you, Gaumata, the false! I serve the
gracious Princess of the house of Cyrus!”</p>

<p>“You will be torn in pieces! Open, I say! I will
have you roasted to death! I will afflict you with spells!
Open! I command!”</p>

<p>“Never! I warn you that I will slay any man who
attempts to harm my sovereign lady!”</p>

<p>The King and Patatheites took counsel and sought to
beguile the giant guard.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said the priest. “We mean no harm to
the Princess. But she must marry the King now and
must march with us at daybreak to Hamadan and proclaim
their union. Open, and I swear she will not be
harmed, and you shall be the first officer of the army!”</p>

<p>But Gustasp growled a refusal. He was not to be deluded.
Then began Patatheites to curse him and to call
down the anger of all the gods upon him. He cursed
him by the sun whose beams would strike him down; by
the moon whose rays would drive him insane; by the
rivers which would drown him; by the hills which would
fall on him; and by the devils who would ever pursue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
him. So bitter and dreadful were his words that stout
Gustasp paled and trembled. With uncertain steps he
paced back and forth across the lower chamber floor,
fearing that from the shadows of the chamber half-lighted
by an oil lamp some specter might leap forth upon
him. A soft step came down the stairs and Gustasp
drew his sword. But it was the Princess. She came to
the trembling giant and placed her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Fear not, Gustasp!” she said reassuringly. “Good
spirits are here around us! Those curses shall not harm
you. Ahura-Mazda has sent me a messenger saying:
‘Fear not! We will help you!’ Be strong and brave,
Gustasp. See, I tremble not.”</p>

<p>The giant guard heaved up his broad shoulders, and a
cheerful smile passed across his rugged features.</p>

<p>“Have no fear that I will falter, most gracious lady,”
he said. “Let them curse. If they come within reach
of my spear, their curses will stop short!”</p>

<p>At length the cursing ceased. The King and the chief
priest withdrew a space to consult. Presently they
ordered a company of soldiers with a beam for a battering-ram
to break down the door. The stout planks
and bars soon quivered beneath heavy blows. Gustasp,
seeing that it would presently fall, retreated up the
narrow stairway to the upper chamber and proceeded to
barricade it with furniture. A heavy divan was pressed
into the narrow stair, leaving barely space at one side
through which a spear might be thrust. Tables and
benches were piled upon this. Then Gustasp, spear in
hand, stood ready. The door below presently gave way
and a squad of soldiers rushed into the room below.
Finding it empty, they immediately began to ascend the
stair; but, the moment one appeared in the narrow passage,
the long blade of Gustasp’s spear flashed down
upon him and he tumbled back gasping, with a terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
wound in his chest. A second tried the ascent and had
his face slashed open. This cooled the ardor of the
assailants. They drew back to take counsel. No one
dared further attempt the deadly stair.</p>

<p>Then Athura heard a voice, cold, calm, and ironical,
saying: “It seems to me far beneath the dignity of a
King of the World to be leading a drunken mob in
attack upon a woman! I say to you now that I for one
do not approve!”</p>

<p>“Have a care, Prexaspes!” replied the voice of
Patatheites. “Such words to the King are not to be
spoken lightly!”</p>

<p>“Bah!” was the rejoinder in a loud voice that was
heard by every man in the fortress. “Who are you to
threaten me? Do you desire to break with me? If so,
I will lead my Medes over to the Prince. I say to you,
stop this rioting and give your thoughts to the enemy!
If I be not greatly mistaken, we shall have the Persians
upon us before noon to-morrow. I will venture all I
have that the Prince is commander of that company
approaching Nicæa! If so, his coming will be like a
whirlwind. I am going down to the camp, and I demand
that the King go with me. I demand that no further
violence be attempted against the Princess Athura. I
warn you that if we injure her and lose this battle, the
Prince of Iran will flay and quarter every man in this
fortress!”</p>

<p>His words greatly impressed all hearers and, after
further angry altercation, Prexaspes triumphed and the
drunken priests were ordered to return to their cells
while Gaumata sulkily mounted a horse and rode with
him down to the camp.</p>

<p>Athura praised Gustasp and presented to him a gold
ring, which in after years the guard and his descendants
treasured above all other possessions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>THE OVERTHROW OF THE MAGI</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ATHURA slept little during the remainder of the
night. She insisted on watching a part of the time,
while Gustasp slept stretched out on the floor and the
maids tried to rest. She watched while the stars paled
and the gray light of the dawn grew into rosy sunrise
and cloudless day. Her eyes eagerly scanned the horizon
towards Nicæa. As soon as the light was sufficient,
she saw moving bodies of horsemen concentrating in
the plain near the base of the hill on which the castle
stood. She had often seen large bodies of troops, and
she estimated that not less than thirty thousand were
there. Officers were busily riding hither and thither
placing them in line with their faces towards Nicæa.</p>

<p>When Gustasp awoke and observed the movements of
the troopers, he gave it as his opinion that an attack was
expected. Nor was he mistaken. For about mid-forenoon
they observed two bodies of cavalry approaching
from the direction of Nicæa, one in advance moving
rapidly and the other more deliberately. The advance
body was evidently a scouting party sent out by Prexaspes,
and it soon joined his array. The pursuers came
on in wide, extended order, their masses glittering with
armor and spear-points. At their head rode two men,
conspicuous on white steeds.</p>

<p>“Look, Gustasp!” exclaimed Athura, while the pursuers
were yet far away. “Is it not the Prince—the
one at the right? Is that not Gobryas at his left?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>Gustasp shaded his eyes and looked closely at the
distant figures. He smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“My eyes are counted good, gracious lady, but I
cannot see any difference in those men,” he answered.
“If I had eyes as young as yours, I might distinguish
them. But I know those are the Persians of the Imperial
Guard. The Prince must be with them. They
are not half as numerous as the false King’s men, but
they are veterans and the best soldiers in the world. It
will be a short battle.”</p>

<p>The Persians came on until they were within a thousand
paces of their antagonists, when they halted. The two
leaders rode forward to a slight eminence two hundred
paces in advance, from which they attentively surveyed
the field. It was well suited for battle between bodies
of cavalry. While somewhat rolling and uneven, there
were no ditches or swamps. The Medean line was more
extended than the Persian and no less massive and deep.
The Persian leaders soon returned to their lines and the
watchers on the hills perceived a movement of the rear
ranks to the left, where presently a body of troops was
massed three times as great in depth as the general line.</p>

<p>“The Prince has made a hammer of his left,” said
Gustasp. “Now look at his right! It bends back so
that the Medes may not overlap and attack the Persian
rear!”</p>

<p>It was even so. For when the Persians moved forward
again there was a perceptible bending back of their
right wing until it moved forward <i>en echelon</i> to the
remainder of the line.</p>

<p>Then came two men from the Persians who rode
rapidly up to the Medes and demanded a parley.
Prexaspes and the King met them and received a message
from the Prince of Iran demanding the surrender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
of the Princess Athura and of the false King, and
promising pardon to all the other Medes save Prexaspes.
These demands were refused. The heralds rode back to
the Prince and reported, who then ordered his army to
advance.</p>

<p>The Persians came on at a smart trot until within five
hundred yards. Then the front ranks leveled their
spears, bent their bodies forward, and pressed their
horses into a gallop. Prexaspes ordered his troops forward
to meet the onset. The earth shook with the
thunder of hoofs. A deep-toned roar went up from the
Persians, their battle shout which had terrified many a
nation. The Medes answered with a medley of yells.
The lines came together with a terrific shock. Men were
unhorsed. Horses reared, plunged, and went down.
Screams of agony mingled with battle-shouts. The lines
wavered and stood still, it seemed, for the space of five
minutes. Then was seen the power of discipline. The
Medes, while brave, were not inured to battle. After
the first shock, they became confused. They were overthrown,
ridden down, and pushed back. Struggling
fruitlessly against the terrible spears of their enemies,
they receded. The Persians raised shouts of victory and
pressed their advantage. The Prince of Iran, leading
the center, rode over Prexaspes, broke through the
Medean lines, and made directly for the King. The
latter turned his horse and fled towards his castle, with
the Prince and Gobryas close at his heels. So close was
the pursuit that Gaumata and his men had no time to
close the brazen gates of the castle, which were opened
to receive them, before the Prince and Gobryas with a
company of Persians pressed through and attacked the
garrison fiercely. Demoralized by the fall of Prexaspes
and the flight of Gaumata, the Medean army scattered
and fled from the field.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>The Prince and Gobryas, swords in hand, pressed
through the confused rabble after Gaumata. They saw
him leap from his horse and enter the castle. Dismounting
they pursued him into the chamber below that where
the Princess Athura had her retreat. Here the false
King turned at bay, unable to escape. The Prince himself
attacked Gaumata, though Gobryas begged the
privilege of slaying him. The struggle was short.
The Prince was an athlete and swordsman; his opponent
was neither. Gaumata’s weapon was whirled from his
hand at the first blow, and the Prince’s blade passed
through his heart, cutting short his cry for mercy.</p>

<p>Athura, trembling with excitement, had seen the battle
and the flight and pursuit of Gaumata, and, from
behind Gustasp’s broad shoulders on the stairs, had
watched the short, sharp combat between the Prince and
the usurper. The Prince, flushed with victory as he
stood above the writhing form of Gaumata, heard her
exclaim, “Ahura-Mazda be praised!” He turned and
their eyes met. He sprang towards Gustasp with
dripping sword, thinking the giant guard an enemy in
charge of the royal captive. But Athura pressed forward
in front of Gustasp, exclaiming, “He is a friend!”</p>

<p>The Prince dropped his sword and extended his arms,
with the light of great love in his eyes. Athura threw
her arms about his mail-covered shoulders. Gustasp
and Gobryas drove back the crowd of Persian troopers
who were pressing in to aid their Prince.</p>

<p>But a chief commander must make an end of greetings,
no matter how entrancing. The Prince and Athura
passed out into the courtyard, now filled with shouting
Persians, some of whom were pursuing the luckless garrison
and cutting them down. When the Persians saw
the radiant Athura standing by the side of their Prince,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
their shouts rent the heavens. For every man who had
taken part in the battle knew that their leader was seeking
to rescue his promised wife, the daughter of the
great Cyrus.</p>

<p>Prexaspes was among the prisoners. His horse had
been killed and had fallen upon him. The Persian
cavalry had passed over him. But save for a broken
arm, he was not seriously injured. He was brought before
the Prince. His countenance showed signs of suffering,
but the usual calm, cynical smile rested upon it
and he exhibited no fear. The Prince looked upon him
sternly.</p>

<p>“At last, Prexaspes,” he said, “you have come to a
day of judgment! What have you to say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, great Prince,” he answered. “Fate has
turned against me. I am in your hands, a prisoner of
war.”</p>

<p>“But how could you, a noble of Medea, conspire with
that carrion, Gaumata? And you even obeyed him as
King!”</p>

<p>“I did not conspire. I was faithful to Cambyses till
he died—even though he did slay my son, as you know,
in cruel jest. I did not conspire against him. What
could I do after his death? By the command of Cambyses,
I had slain Prince Bardya. For that crime I knew
that I would be slain by you. So I came and offered my
sword to the false King. He obeyed me, not I him!”</p>

<p>The Prince contemplated his prisoner gloomily. No
man ever more admired courage than he. Prexaspes
smiled in the face of death. What punishment should
be meted out to such a man?</p>

<p>“For taking Bardya’s life, you have merited death,”
said the Prince, finally. “But you are a brave man.
You shall die as such. Tell me, Prexaspes, how did
Bardya die?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“I expect to die,” answered Prexaspes, and the pain
and despair of his soul snatched away the smile from his
face, leaving his handsome features haggard and drawn.
“Remorse has been with me, since by this hand the stout
young Prince departed! I will tell you. Cambyses was
jealous of Bardya. His advisers, the Magian priests, who
by their wonder works had made much impression on the
King’s mind, also hated Bardya because he clung to the
ancient religion of Iran and was an enemy to their religion.
They knew that with Bardya as King they would
never gain power in the state. They hinted to the
King that Bardya contemplated rebellion. They artfully
brought stories of the young man’s popularity.
They advised his death. It was then that the King laid
his command upon me to slay his brother. The Magian
priests sent a body of their armed followers to lie in wait
on the road to Rhages that night when the feast in honor
of the Prince’s departure was held; and I rode with
Bardya that night until, as prearranged, they attacked us.
Then, in the mêlée, I struck the Prince with my sword
and he died. Was not the Great King’s word law? I
executed his word, without malice towards the Prince.
But I am weary of life! My wife is dead. Cambyses
slew my son. I have run the full course of power and
wealth. I am your prisoner, ready to die. But know
this, great Prince, I have never advised Cambyses against
your interests!”</p>

<p>The Prince listened attentively and believed that
Prexaspes spoke truthfully. He turned to Athura, who
had listened to the recital, and asked, “What do you
advise?”</p>

<p>Athura shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>“I cannot advise,” she said. “Last night when the
drunken priests and the false King attempted to break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
into the castle and do me harm, this man interfered and
compelled them to cease.”</p>

<p>“For that, Prexaspes, I would pardon you, had I the
power,” said the Prince, turning to the prisoner. “I
could order you slain now, but I cannot slay you.
Prexaspes, you have deserved my gratitude. I grant
you life for the present. I am not the King. My father
is King of Iran. There is no King of Kings; until the
nobles of Bactra, Persia, and Medea shall select one of
the Achæmenian line. You shall go to Hamadan to be
judged.”</p>

<p>“Rather would I be slain by you now,” responded
Prexaspes, earnestly. “Let me die a soldier’s death,
not the death of a dog condemned for murder!”</p>

<p>The Prince was troubled. He hesitated. Sympathy
for a brave man moved him.</p>

<p>“I promise you this, Prexaspes,” he said after a moment
of consideration. “If you will testify before the
council of nobles and to the people, that this Gaumata
was a false traitor and not Bardya and that Bardya was
slain by your hand, I promise that you may choose the
manner of your death. The King and the nobles will
heed my promise. They will not deny me. If you make
this confession and implicate the Magian priest, they will
pursue you with bitter vengeance. It is said that their
death penalties are tortures such as even fiends would
not inflict. We could not save you from them. It is
the ancient law that one who lifts his hand against one
of the Achæmenian race must die. Is it not so? And
this law, not even the King may set aside.”</p>

<p>“It is so!” answered Prexaspes. “I will testify before
the people and the council, in order that your reign
as King of Kings may not be disturbed by other false
Bardyas. I advise that you carry this Gaumata’s head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
to Hamadan and exhibit it in the market that all may
see. I myself will ascend the criers’ tower and confess
the death of Bardya to the people. So be it. I will
choose my own death.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” said the Prince, “Gobryas shall be your
keeper. He will treat you as a brave soldier should
treat a brave soldier unlucky enough to be a captive.
We shall rest here this night. On the morrow we march
to Hamadan.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>KING OF KINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT evening the Prince, accompanied by Athura,
ascended the narrow stairs leading to the flat top
of the castle-tower and, seated on the low parapet that
surrounded it, watched the sun set in golden splendor.
They found an altar of heavy stones, rudely squared, in
the center of the roof. It bore marks of long usage.
But the fire which had blazed on it for years was dead.
Only ashes remained.</p>

<p>The evening was pleasant. The sky was a deep, blue
dome. The wide plain to the south, surrounded on all
sides by hills, the high mountains to the north and east,
with their sharp crags and peaks, with Elwend and her
snow in the east and Demavend far to the northeast, a
diamond point of eternal white, were of entrancing
beauty. The Prince for a time forgot battles and
marches. Athura forgot the long years of waiting and
watching. They were lovers now, rank and royalty forgotten,
man and maid, each glorified by the other’s love.
The sun stood still in the heavens and the hills rolled
up and concealed him. Darkness enveloped them, and
they were oblivious of all else than themselves. The
stars appeared, brilliant points in the depths of space.
The moon rose and drove the shadows from the hilltops
into the depths of canyon and gulch. A great owl
winged his way slowly about the tower and, alighting on
the altar, peered at them suspiciously. When they
moved he flapped away into the shadows of the hills.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
Bats flitted hither and thither like restless spirits. A
wolf howled in the distant mountains. The low hum of
conversation came up from the soldiers gathered about
camp-fires in the courtyard. In such surroundings, the
royal lovers again took up and tied the broken threads
of life and renewed their vows to each other.</p>

<p>Morning brought with it activity. The castle was
abandoned. The army marched to Hamadan. A special
guard of gayly-caparisoned officers rode near the
litter in which the Princess was borne, or followed the
horse on which, at times, she chose to ride by the side
of the Prince. There was no organized opposition to
the march. Bands of soldiers, which were riding to the
aid of the false King, returned to their homes, stunned by
the sudden overthrow of their leader. Gaumata’s head
was borne aloft on a pike-staff; and, in every hamlet
and village, a crier called the people together and told
them of the false King’s deception and death.</p>

<p>So it came about that the cavalry under the Prince
and the infantry under the King of Iran came together
near Hamadan, entered the city without encountering
resistance, and relieved Captains Arios and Mardux, not
only of their danger but also of their soft living in the
palace of the Great King. But in appreciation of their
valiant service, they were promoted to higher grades in
the Imperial Guard and later they became chief officers
of the Guard.</p>

<p>On the day that they entered Hamadan, Athura became
the wife of the Prince of Iran. The marriage
feast was held in the palace. After the feast, the great
nobles of Iran were called into the throne room by King
Hystaspis, who, sitting on the throne in state, addressed
them thus:</p>

<p>“Nobles of the Aryan race, I have called you hither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
to ask what is your will concerning the throne left by
Cyrus and Cambyses. By right of birth, I, the head
of the Achæmenian family, am entitled to reign in Iran.
I am King of Iran. But while Iran rules the world,
the victories of Cyrus established such rule and his authority
was paramount to mine. I am old and desire
to live the few years that may be mine in ease. I desire
not to assume the burden that must be borne by the
King of Kings. For I foresee that some of the conquered
provinces will rebel and that wars will come.
The line of Cyrus is dead, all save the Princess who this
day has become the wife of my son. It is my command
that all here speak freely.”</p>

<p>Otanes stepped forth and looked about him a moment
in silence. Then his eyes rested upon the Prince of
Iran and his beautiful bride, who sat at the right hand
of King Hystaspis. He bowed low before them.</p>

<p>“There can be but one choice, O King,” he said
gravely. “The royal power has ever been in the Achæmenian
family. As long as there are men of that royal
line, none others may dare to aspire to the throne. If
you, Sire, refuse to reign, there stands the well-beloved
Prince, your son, whose wisdom and valor are far beyond
his years, whose name is on every soldier’s tongue,
as the hero of his race! By him stands Athura, most
beautiful, most royal in birth. Has not your family and
the family of Cyrus united? Let Darius Hystaspis be
King of Kings and Athura, the daughter of Cyrus, be
his Queen! Thus will all the peoples be contented and
the world be blest. What say you, nobles of Iran?”</p>

<p>A roar of assent was the response.</p>

<p>“Let the crown of Cyrus be brought hither!” commanded
the King.</p>

<p>A double crown, one part of which was silver and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
the other of gold, studded with gems, was brought forth.
The King gravely rose from his throne and, addressing
his son, said:</p>

<p>“You have heard the choice of the nobles of Iran,
my beloved son! In the presence of these men, I now
renounce in your behalf the supreme rule of the world.
Here and now I crown you King of Kings and Lord of
Lords. Rule wisely and well. As King of Iran, I
acknowledge you supreme Lord and will support your
throne forever!”</p>

<p>The Prince, much affected, knelt at his father’s feet
and received upon his head the double crown, which the
great Cyrus had made as a symbol of his everlasting
dominion over the kings of the world. Then he rose
and sat down upon the throne, with Athura at his right
hand and his father at his left. The great lords of
Persia came and did obeisance to him and bent their
right knees before him. Thus Darius Hystaspis became
the Great King, and proved to be the wisest and greatest
of them all. For, to the military ability of the heroic
Cyrus, he added the wisdom of a statesman, the greatest
of his age; and, in addition, he was a lover of art and
science.</p>

<p>On the following day, at noon, in response to the call
of public criers, a vast concourse of people gathered in
and around the public square or market-place in Hamadan.
Soldiers of the Persian army were massed at one
side. The nobility, men of note and strangers, were
massed on the other. In the midst, the public criers’
tower arose forty feet in air, and from it, the people
understood, announcement would be made concerning
the accession of Darius Hystaspis to the throne as King
of Kings.</p>

<p>The people were restive. A bitter factional feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
had arisen during the reign of the false Bardya. The
followers of the Magi, being in favor, had lorded it over
the more orthodox Medes and Persians, had even prohibited
their worship, and had taken away from their
priests the revenues on which they lived. When Gaumata
fell and the Persian army entered the capital, the
persecuted ones in turn had come forth and assumed a
haughty spirit towards the Magians. In all parts of
Medea, as well as in the capital city, was the same unrest.
Men hated their neighbors on account of religion,
the most deadly hatred that men may entertain, and were
ready to slay each other. It needed only the excitement
of a great gathering to set afire the smoldering embers
of hate. The eyes of all turned often to the gruesome
spectacle of an earless head on the top of a pole planted
near the tower in such position that the populace could
see it. A squad of soldiers guarded it from being overthrown
by the pressure of the crowd. It was the distorted
and blackened face of Gaumata.</p>

<p>At noon there issued from the palace a company consisting
of the Great King, his Queen, his father, and the
nobles of Iran, and they rode between massed lines of
soldiers to a position near the tower. They were received
with loud acclaim and clashing of weapons. A
trumpet pealed forth from the tower, and a deep silence
fell upon the people. Then Prexaspes appeared, accompanied
by Gobryas and two armed guards.</p>

<p>Prexaspes was carefully dressed. His hair and whiskers
were curled and perfumed. His rich Medean cloak
was gracefully parted so as to display to advantage his
jeweled vestments. He was at once recognized, and a
subdued murmur of wonder passed through the crowd.
He raised his hand in graceful gesture, and said in a
loud voice:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“Behold me, Prexaspes, most unhappy of men! I am
about to die and let my death, suffered righteously,
attest the truth of my words!”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, to let his hearers grasp his meaning.
Then he told the story of the plots by which the
Magi had influenced Cambyses to order the death of
Bardya and how he himself had slain the Prince with
their aid; how they had then conspired against Cambyses
and caused his overthrow and death; how they had
set up Gaumata, the earless one, to be King, falsely
representing him to be Bardya, and had placed the
Magian on the throne of the world; and, finally, how
the false King had been overthrown.</p>

<p>For the first time the populace knew that the Magi
had slain Bardya and that a pretender had through their
plots usurped the royal power. Every man looked at
his fellow and laid his hand on the dagger at his belt.
Hatred, fanned by the speaker’s revelations, blazed up;
and a growl of anger passed throughout the vast crowd.
Prexaspes ceased at last and for a moment stood in
silence. Then he added:</p>

<p>“I have told you all! There, on yonder pole, is the
head of false Gaumata! My hand is red with the blood
of an Achæmenian Prince, and by the law I must die!
By the grace of the mighty King of Kings, Darius, son
of Hystaspis, who is this day your King, I die as I
choose. I salute you, O King! May you live forever!”</p>

<p>He bowed towards the King, who sat still on his
horse, sorrowfully contemplating the speaker. Then
Prexaspes calmly opened his cloak and drew a long, keen
dagger from his belt. He poised the dagger in air an
instant, then drove it to the hilt in his breast. For a
moment he stood smiling down upon the King, then his
knees gave away and he fell, headlong, from the tower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
to the foot of the pole on which the hideous head of
Gaumata leered. A murmur of horror ran through the
vast throng. It increased in volume as the people spoke
to each other. It rose to a vast roar in a moment and
its burden was: “The Magi! They slew Bardya!
Down with the Magi! Slay the Magi!”</p>

<p>There was a movement in the great throng. Here and
there daggers and swords flashed. Screams of agony
arose. The crowd swayed hither and thither. Then it
scattered, and broke into groups under self-elected leaders
who chased the frightened Magi and slew them
wherever found. A riot of bloodshed and slaughter ran
throughout the country such as Medea had not seen since
that day, hundreds of years ago, when the Scythians had
been massacred. Every man who had a Magian neighbor
assaulted him. The house of every Magian priest
was broken open and pillaged and its occupants slain or
chased into the hills. It is said that a hundred thousand
Magians died, before the King, with the aid of unwilling
Persian soldiers, succeeded in stopping the slaughter.
So deep-seated was the hatred of the orthodox Aryans
towards the Magians that on the anniversary of this day
hereafter it was the practice to slay every one of that
sect that was found on the highway. The King made a
decree that on such anniversary no Magian should leave
his house and that if he did so and was killed, his slayer
would not be punished.</p>

<p>But the remainder of our story is history. The kingdom
of the Medes and Persians, or rather, the Kingdom
of Iran, the rule of the Aryans, reached its zenith of
power and glory under Darius Hystaspis, called Darius
the Great. Well did he deserve the title “Great.” For
he made laws for all the world save Greece and Rome.
His coinage became the world standard. The provinces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
of his empire were ruled by kings. His public roads
and rapid messenger service enabled him personally to
supervise the general welfare of all his provinces. He
invited men of letters to his court. He engraved his history
on tablets and on the great rocks at Behistun and
Persepolis. He brought architects and builders from
Egypt, Palestine, and Phœnicia, and made for himself
and his Queen a palace at Persepolis, whose stately ruins
are yet mute witnesses of his power and magnificence.
He had to reconquer many of the nations of Asia,
which, because he was a young man and because religious
feuds had torn Iran into factions, thought to free
themselves. He redeemed his promise to Belteshazzer,
the great Daniel of the Hebrew scriptures, and caused
Jerusalem to be rebuilt, and he restored the Jews to
their country. He restored the ancient religion of the
Aryans and banished the false religion of the Magi,
the Lie, from his empire. He worshiped God, whether
named Jehovah by the Jew or Ahura-Mazda by his own
people. His religion was pure and lofty.</p>

<p>But most of all did he love and honor his Queen,
Athura, whose praises the world sang in those days, and
whose fame has been preserved in various narratives,
none of which agree except that all ascribe to her great
wisdom and beauty. Together they ruled their empire
many years, and their reign was the golden age of the
Aryan race.</p>
